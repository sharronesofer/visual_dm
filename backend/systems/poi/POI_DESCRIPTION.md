# Point of Interest (POI) System - Business Logic Report

## Overview

The Point of Interest (POI) system is a comprehensive world simulation engine that manages all significant locations in the game world. This includes cities, towns, villages, fortresses, mines, dungeons, ruins, and other notable places. The system handles everything from procedural generation of new locations to complex economic simulation, population dynamics, and political control.

## POI Interaction Types - The Gameplay Experience

**Critical for Game Design**: Every POI has an `interaction_type` that determines what kind of gameplay experience players encounter:

### Social POIs (`SOCIAL`, `TRADE`, `DIPLOMACY`)
- **Purpose**: Focused on NPC interactions, commerce, and peaceful activities
- **Examples**: Cities, towns, markets, temples
- **Player Activities**: Trading, gathering information, accepting quests, diplomacy, recruitment
- **Atmosphere**: Safe, populated, conversation-heavy

### Combat POIs (`COMBAT`)  
- **Purpose**: Designed for tactical encounters and hostile interactions
- **Examples**: Bandit camps, monster lairs, hostile fortresses
- **Player Activities**: Fighting, tactical positioning, looting, conquest
- **Atmosphere**: Dangerous, requires preparation, skill-based

### Exploration POIs (`EXPLORATION`, `QUEST`)
- **Purpose**: Discovery-focused with puzzles, secrets, and lore
- **Examples**: Ancient ruins, hidden caves, abandoned sites, landmarks
- **Player Activities**: Searching, puzzle-solving, uncovering history, finding secrets
- **Atmosphere**: Mystery, discovery, often isolated

### Neutral POIs (`NEUTRAL`)
- **Purpose**: Mixed or context-dependent interactions
- **Examples**: Outposts, settlements with changing allegiances
- **Player Activities**: Varies based on current state and faction control
- **Atmosphere**: Unpredictable, situation-dependent

**Why This Matters**: This classification system allows the game to:
- Generate appropriate content for each location type
- Set player expectations about what they'll encounter
- Balance different gameplay styles across the world
- Enable procedural generation that creates varied experiences

## Business Logic by Module

### Core POI Management (`services.py`)

**What it does**: This is the foundation of the entire system. It provides basic operations for creating, reading, updating, and deleting POIs.

**Key business rules**:
- Every POI must have a unique name within the system
- POIs can be in various states (active, inactive) and have different types (city, town, village, etc.)
- POIs are soft-deleted (marked inactive) rather than permanently removed
- The system tracks creation and modification timestamps for audit purposes
- POIs can be searched by name or description and filtered by status
- Statistics tracking provides overview of total and active POI counts

**Why it matters**: Without this foundation, no other POI functionality would work. It ensures data integrity and provides the basic operations all other services depend on.

### POI State Management (`poi_state_service.py`)

**What it does**: Controls how POIs change over time based on population, resources, conflicts, and other factors.

**Key business rules**:
- POIs can transition between states: ACTIVE → GROWING → DECLINING → ABANDONED → RUINS
- State changes require specific conditions (population thresholds, time requirements, resource availability)
- The system prevents invalid transitions (you can't go directly from ACTIVE to RUINS without intermediate states)
- Some transitions require faction involvement (repopulating abandoned areas needs faction investment)
- Automatic evaluation suggests state changes based on current conditions
- Force override allows administrators to change states for storytelling purposes

**Real-world logic**: This simulates how real settlements rise and fall. A thriving town might decline due to resource depletion, become abandoned if people leave, and eventually turn to ruins if not reclaimed.

**Why it matters**: This creates dynamic, living world where player actions and time passage have meaningful consequences. Cities can rise and fall based on player decisions and world events.

### Procedural Generation (`poi_generator.py`)

**What it does**: Creates new POIs automatically using algorithms that consider geography, resources, and existing settlements.

**Key business rules**:
- Different POI types have different placement preferences (cities near water, mines in mountains)
- Minimum distance constraints prevent overcrowding (cities can't be too close to each other)
- Generation considers biome compatibility (swamps are bad for most settlements)
- Population scaling varies by POI type (cities start larger than villages)
- Resource dependencies ensure logical placement (farms need fertile areas)
- Trade route requirements for larger settlements

**Real-world logic**: This mimics how real settlements form - near resources, transportation routes, and with appropriate spacing for their size and function.

**Why it matters**: Allows the game world to expand procedurally with realistic, logical placement of new settlements that feel natural rather than random.

### Urban Development (`metropolitan_spread_service.py`)

**What it does**: Models how cities expand beyond their original boundaries to form larger metropolitan areas.

**Key business rules**:
- Cities expand when population exceeds thresholds and economic conditions are favorable
- Expansion follows hexagonal grid patterns for consistent area calculation
- Metropolitan areas can encompass multiple smaller POIs
- Expansion has costs that must be met through economic strength
- Growth rates and economic pressure drive expansion timing
- Different urban sizes (hamlet → village → town → city → metropolis) have different expansion rules

**Real-world logic**: This reflects how real cities grow outward, absorbing nearby settlements and creating suburban areas as population and economy grow.

**Why it matters**: Creates realistic urban growth patterns and allows players to see the long-term effects of successful city management.

### Economic Simulation (`resource_management_service.py`)

**What it does**: Models the complex economic interactions within and between POIs, including production, consumption, storage, and trade.

**Key business rules**:
- Different resource types have different properties (spoilage rates, storage requirements, base values)
- Production capabilities vary by POI type and available workforce
- Resources can spoil over time if not properly stored
- Trade offers can be created between POIs with expiration dates
- Resource quality affects value and utility
- Production modifiers account for seasons, technology, population, and other factors

**Real-world logic**: This simulates a medieval/fantasy economy where different settlements specialize in different resources and must trade to meet all their needs.

**Why it matters**: Creates meaningful economic gameplay where player decisions about resource management, trade routes, and production facilities have lasting impacts.

### Population Dynamics (`migration_service.py`)

**What it does**: Manages how people move between POIs in response to various triggers and conditions.

**Key business rules**:
- Multiple migration types (voluntary, forced, seasonal, trade-based, refugee)
- Various triggers cause migration (overcrowding, resource scarcity, conflict, economic opportunity)
- Migration groups have success/failure rates based on route safety and group resources
- Travel time depends on distance, group size, and seasonal conditions
- Demographic tracking includes age distribution, occupations, and cultural groups
- POIs have limits on how many migrants they can send or receive

**Real-world logic**: This mirrors how real populations move in response to economic, political, and environmental pressures.

**Why it matters**: Creates realistic population flows that respond to player actions and world events, making the world feel alive and reactive.

### Political Control (`faction_influence_service.py`)

**What it does**: Manages which factions control POIs, how influence changes over time, and political interactions between factions.

**Key business rules**:
- Factions have different characteristics (military strength, economic power, cultural influence)
- Multiple types of influence (political, economic, cultural, military)
- Influence actions cost resources and have success/failure rates
- Faction relationships affect interactions (allied, neutral, hostile)
- Treasury management for faction actions
- Automatic AI-driven faction behavior

**Real-world logic**: This simulates political control and influence as seen in historical settings where different powers compete for control of territories.

**Why it matters**: Creates meaningful political gameplay where faction choices and diplomatic actions have consequences for territorial control.

### World Events (`lifecycle_events_service.py`)

**What it does**: Generates and processes random events that affect POIs over time, adding unpredictability and narrative elements.

**Key business rules**:
- Different event types (disasters, celebrations, economic, political, environmental)
- Severity levels determine impact magnitude
- Frequency controls how often events occur
- Events can have prerequisites and trigger conditions
- Template system allows for reusable event patterns
- Events can affect multiple POI attributes simultaneously

**Real-world logic**: This reflects how real settlements are affected by unpredictable events beyond their control.

**Why it matters**: Adds narrative interest and prevents the simulation from becoming too predictable, requiring players to adapt to changing circumstances.

### Special Features (`landmark_service.py`)

**What it does**: Manages unique landmarks and special features that provide gameplay benefits, quests, or narrative significance.

**Key business rules**:
- Landmarks have rarity levels affecting their frequency and power
- Activation requirements control access (population, faction control, resources)
- Status tracking (hidden, discovered, active, claimed)
- Effects can boost POI capabilities or provide special benefits
- Quest integration for landmark-related challenges
- Some landmarks can only be claimed by specific faction types

**Real-world logic**: This represents unique geographical features, historical sites, or constructed wonders that provide special advantages.

**Why it matters**: Adds unique gameplay elements and goals beyond basic settlement management, providing special objectives and benefits.

### Frontend Integration (`unity_frontend_integration.py`)

**What it does**: Translates backend simulation data into formats the Unity game client can display and allows client actions to trigger backend changes.

**Key business rules**:
- Different message types for various kinds of data updates
- Update frequencies control how often data is synchronized
- Data transformation between backend models and Unity-compatible formats
- Performance monitoring and system health tracking
- Event notifications for real-time updates

**Why it matters**: Enables the complex backend simulation to be visualized and interacted with through the game interface.

### Event Communication (`event_integration_service.py`)

**What it does**: Provides a standardized way for different parts of the POI system to communicate events and react to changes.

**Key business rules**:
- Event priority levels determine processing order
- Subscription system allows services to listen for specific event types
- Event publishing with automatic subscriber notification
- Decorator system for automatic event publication

**Why it matters**: Ensures different subsystems can react to changes in other parts of the system, maintaining consistency and enabling complex interactions.

## Integration with Broader Codebase

### Faction System Integration
The POI system heavily integrates with the faction system through the `faction_influence_service.py`. Changes in POI control affect faction power, and faction actions can influence POI development and state transitions.

### Economic Impact
Resource management and trade systems likely feed into broader economic systems. POI economic health affects faction treasuries and regional stability.

### World State Management
POI states and events contribute to overall world state, affecting quest availability, NPC behavior, and player opportunities.

### Event System Integration
The POI system both publishes and subscribes to game-wide events, ensuring changes in POIs trigger appropriate responses in other systems.

### Database Dependencies
All services rely on the infrastructure layer for data persistence, using the ORM models defined in the infrastructure layer.

## Maintenance Concerns

### ✅ **RESOLVED Issues**

1. **Tilemap Service**: `services/tilemap_service.py` - **IMPLEMENTED** - Now includes complete tilemap generation with different layout strategies for combat, exploration, and social POIs, including interactive object placement and Unity integration
2. **Unity Integration Placeholders**: `services/unity_frontend_integration.py` - **FIXED** - Replaced placeholder return values with proper calculations for global economic health and political stability based on actual POI data

### Remaining Code Quality Issues

1. **Large Service Files**: Several services (landmark_service.py: 805 lines, unity_frontend_integration.py: 694 lines) are quite large and could benefit from breaking into smaller, more focused modules

2. **Complex State Management**: The state transition system in `poi_state_service.py` has intricate rules that could be extracted into a more data-driven configuration

3. **Missing Error Handling**: Some service methods lack comprehensive error handling, particularly in the generation and migration services

4. **Database Session Management**: Inconsistent patterns for database session handling across services

### Potential Logic Contradictions

1. **Resource Spoilage vs. Long-term Storage**: The resource system implements spoilage, but some trade and migration scenarios assume resources can be stored indefinitely

2. **Population Limits**: Different services calculate population limits differently (migration capacity vs. metropolitan expansion thresholds)

3. **State Transition Timing**: Some services assume immediate state changes while others implement time-based transitions

### Performance Concerns

1. **Daily Processing**: Multiple services have daily processing methods that could become expensive with large numbers of POIs

2. **Distance Calculations**: Frequent distance calculations in metropolitan spread and migration services without optimization

3. **Event Dispatch**: Heavy use of event publishing without apparent batching or throttling mechanisms

## Modular Cleanup Opportunities

### Configuration Externalization

1. **State Transition Rules** (`poi_state_service.py`): The complex state transition rules and thresholds could be moved to JSON configuration files, allowing game designers to modify state change behavior without code changes.

2. **POI Generation Rules** (`poi_generator.py`): POI placement rules, biome preferences, and generation probabilities could be externalized to JSON, enabling easy balancing and mod support.

3. **Resource Definitions** (`resource_management_service.py`): Resource types, spoilage rates, base values, and production requirements could be moved to JSON configuration, allowing for easy addition of new resources.

4. **Migration Triggers and Rules** (`migration_service.py`): Migration triggers, success rates, and demographic templates could be data-driven rather than hard-coded.

5. **Event Templates** (`lifecycle_events_service.py`): Event definitions, probabilities, and effects could be externalized to JSON, allowing content creators to add new events without programming.

6. **Faction Characteristics** (`faction_influence_service.py`): Faction types, default characteristics, and influence calculation formulas could be moved to configuration files.

### Benefits of JSON Configuration

- **Non-programmer Accessibility**: Game designers and content creators could modify game balance without touching code
- **Easier Balancing**: Values could be tweaked and tested rapidly without recompilation
- **Mod Support**: Community could create new content by providing JSON configuration files
- **A/B Testing**: Different configurations could be easily swapped for testing
- **Localization**: Event descriptions and POI names could be externalized for translation
- **Version Control**: Configuration changes would be tracked separately from code changes

### Suggested JSON Structure Examples

```json
{
  "state_transitions": {
    "ACTIVE_to_DECLINING": {
      "required_conditions": ["population_decrease", "resource_shortage"],
      "population_threshold": {"max": 50},
      "time_requirement_days": 14,
      "probability_modifier": 1.0
    }
  },
  "poi_generation_rules": {
    "CITY": {
      "probability_base": 0.02,
      "min_distance_same_type": 200.0,
      "preferred_biomes": ["grassland", "coastal"],
      "population_scaling": 2.0
    }
  },
  "resources": {
    "food": {
      "category": "basic",
      "base_value": 1.0,
      "spoilage_rate": 0.1,
      "storage_type": "cold_storage"
    }
  }
}
```

This approach would make the POI system much more maintainable and allow for rapid iteration on game balance and content.
