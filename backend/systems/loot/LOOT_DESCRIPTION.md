## Core Business Logic Explained

### Item Generation Process
1. **Context Analysis**: Evaluate biome, faction control, economic conditions, character level
2. **Rarity Determination**: Apply configured probability distributions with contextual modifiers
3. **Base Item Selection**: Choose from appropriate item pools based on context and rarity
4. **Property Assignment**: Generate stats, enchantments, and special abilities
5. **Economic Valuation**: Calculate base value using real market conditions
6. **Naming & Flavor**: Generate contextually appropriate names and descriptions
7. **Event Publication**: Notify other systems of item creation

### Item Identification System ⚠️ UNDER REVIEW
**Current Concern:** Multiple identification paths may be too permissive

**Available Methods:**
1. **Skill-based**: Character abilities with success probability based on item rarity
2. **Shop Services**: Pay NPCs for guaranteed identification 
3. **Level-based**: Automatic identification based on character progression
4. **Magical**: Instant identification through spells or special items

**Recommended Solution:** Tiered access system where:
- Common/Uncommon items: Easy identification via multiple methods
- Rare+ items: Require significant skill investment OR expensive services
- Epic/Legendary: Require specialization AND resources

### Shop Economics  
**Dynamic Pricing Model:**
1. **Base Pricing**: Uses real economy manager for market-based pricing
2. **Shop Specialization**: Vendors pay premiums for specialty items
3. **Regional Factors**: Local economic conditions affect all transactions
4. **Vendor Personality**: NPC traits influence negotiation and pricing
5. **Supply/Demand**: Real-time market conditions adjust pricing
6. **Reputation Effects**: Player standing with vendors affects prices

### Enchantment System
**Enchantment Generation:**
1. **Rarity Correlation**: Higher rarity items get more powerful enchantments
2. **Contextual Relevance**: Biome and faction influences affect enchantment types
3. **Power Scaling**: Enchantment strength scales with item level and rarity
4. **Economic Impact**: Enchanted items command higher market prices
5. **Identification Requirements**: Some enchantments hidden until identified

## Configuration Management

### Data-Driven Design ✅ COMPLETED
All game balancing parameters are now externalized to JSON configuration files:

**Rarity Configuration** (`config/rarity_config.json`):
```json
{
  "common": {
    "drop_chance": 60.0,
    "base_value_multiplier": 1.0,
    "identification_difficulty": 5,
    "max_enchantments": 1
  }
}
```

**Economic Configuration** (`config/economic_config.json`):
```json
{
  "base_factors": {
    "inflation_base": 0.02,
    "prosperity_variance": 0.3,
    "trade_volume_impact": 0.15
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Hot-swappable balancing without code deployment
- A/B testing capabilities for different configurations
- Easy regional and seasonal modifications
- Version-controlled balance changes
