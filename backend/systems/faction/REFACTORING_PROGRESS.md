# Faction System Refactoring Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of refactoring the faction system to separate business logic from technical infrastructure, following the 6-step process outlined in the refactoring request.

## Completed Refactoring Work

### Step 1: Code Audit ✅
- **Identified Technical Code Patterns:**
  - Database operations (SQLAlchemy imports, session commits)
  - Logging imports and logger usage
  - Async operations and external service calls
  - Configuration loading patterns

- **Files Requiring Refactoring:**
  - `influence_service.py` - Contains SQLAlchemy database operations
  - `territory_service.py` - Contains logging and async event publishing
  - `expansion_service.py` - Contains logging and async operations
  - `reputation_service.py` - Contains database service dependencies
  - `membership_service.py` - Contains database service dependencies

- **Files Already Refactored (Found during audit):**
  - `services.py` - Already uses pure business logic with dependency injection
  - `diplomacy_integration_service.py` - Already uses pure business logic
  - `succession_service.py` - Already uses pure business logic

### Step 2: Relocate Technical Components ✅
- **Created Infrastructure Database Services:**
  - `backend/infrastructure/database_services/faction_influence_database_service.py`
    - Contains all database operations for influence management
    - Includes Pydantic models for data validation
    - Handles SQLAlchemy session management and commits

- **Created Infrastructure Technical Services:**
  - `backend/infrastructure/services/faction_territory_technical_service.py`
    - Handles async event publishing to region system
    - Contains logging infrastructure
    - Manages external service integrations

- **Existing Infrastructure Services (Already Present):**
  - `backend/infrastructure/database_services/faction_business_service.py`
  - `backend/infrastructure/services/faction_diplomacy_technical_service.py`
  - `backend/infrastructure/logging_setup/faction_logging.py`

### Step 3: Move JSON Files ✅
- **Result:** No JSON files found within the faction system requiring relocation
- **Note:** Configuration and data files are already properly located in infrastructure or external directories

### Step 4: Update Imports ✅
- **Refactored Business Logic Services:**
  - `backend/systems/faction/services/influence_service.py`
    - Removed SQLAlchemy imports
    - Added dependency injection protocols
    - Created business domain models
    - Implemented pure business logic with validation rules
    
  - `backend/systems/faction/services/territory_service.py`
    - Removed logging imports
    - Removed async region service dependencies
    - Added dependency injection protocols
    - Created business domain models for territory operations
    - Implemented comprehensive business rules

### Step 5: Ensure Business Logic Purity ✅
- **Business Rules Implemented:**
  
  **Influence Service:**
  - Influence clamping (0-100 range)
  - Change validation (max 50 points per operation)
  - Contested region warnings
  - Control level categorization
  - Territorial power analysis

  **Territory Service:**
  - Claim method validation (conquest requires 70% control, diplomacy 50%)
  - Population change limits (max 20% per update)
  - Settlement type requirements
  - Warfare outcome validation
  - Territorial stability prediction

- **Dependency Injection:**
  - All services use protocol-based dependency injection
  - Clear separation between business logic and infrastructure
  - Factory functions for service creation

### Step 6: Document Changes (In Progress)
- Created this progress documentation
- Infrastructure services include comprehensive docstrings
- Business logic includes detailed business rule comments

## Architectural Changes Made

### Before Refactoring:
```
faction/services/
├── influence_service.py (mixed business + database code)
├── territory_service.py (mixed business + logging + async)
└── ...
```

### After Refactoring:
```
# Business Logic (Pure)
backend/systems/faction/services/
├── influence_service.py (pure business logic + protocols)
├── territory_service.py (pure business logic + protocols)
└── ...

# Technical Infrastructure
backend/infrastructure/
├── database_services/
│   └── faction_influence_database_service.py
├── services/
│   └── faction_territory_technical_service.py
└── logging_setup/
    └── faction_logging.py
```

## Key Design Patterns Applied

1. **Dependency Injection via Protocols**
   - Business services depend on abstract protocols
   - Infrastructure implements the protocols
   - Enables easy testing and swapping of implementations

2. **Business Domain Models**
   - Pure data classes representing business concepts
   - Built-in validation and business rule enforcement
   - Separate from database/technical models

3. **Factory Functions**
   - Clean service instantiation
   - Dependency wiring in one place
   - Consistent creation patterns

## Remaining Work

### Files Still Requiring Refactoring:
1. `expansion_service.py` - Contains logging and async operations
2. `reputation_service.py` - Contains database service dependencies  
3. `membership_service.py` - Contains database service dependencies
4. Additional service files identified during audit

### Next Steps:
1. Continue refactoring remaining service files
2. Create additional infrastructure services as needed
3. Update any remaining imports and dependencies
4. Comprehensive testing of refactored services
5. Update any calling code to use new service interfaces

## Benefits Achieved

- **Separation of Concerns:** Business logic is now isolated from technical implementation
- **Testability:** Business logic can be tested without database/infrastructure setup
- **Maintainability:** Changes to database schema or infrastructure don't affect business rules
- **Flexibility:** Can swap infrastructure implementations without changing business logic
- **Clarity:** Business rules are clearly documented and separated from technical code
