# Population System Description

## System Overview

The Population System manages NPC generation, population dynamics, demographics, and state transitions for all Points of Interest (POIs) in the game world. It implements dynamic birth/death rates, catastrophe responses, migration patterns, and provides population-driven narrative context for other game systems.

## 1. Logical Subsystems

### **Core Services Subsystem** (`/services/`)
**Purpose:** The heart of the population system that handles all business logic and orchestrates population changes.

- **PopulationService** (`services.py`): The main service that manages CRUD operations, war impacts, catastrophes, resource shortages, migration, and state transitions for populations
- **DemographicAnalysisService** (`demographic_service.py`): Specialized service for complex demographic analysis, projection modeling, and migration flow calculations

### **Mathematical Models Subsystem** (`/utils/`)  
**Purpose:** Implements the mathematical calculations and formulas that drive population behavior.

- **Core Calculations** (`utils.py`): War impact, catastrophe effects, resource consumption, migration, seasonal modifiers, and state management functions
- **Population Utilities** (`population_utils.py`): Simplified calculation functions with enums for war severity and catastrophe types
- **Demographic Models** (`demographic_models.py`): Advanced mathematical models for age-based mortality, fertility rates, life expectancy, settlement dynamics, and population projections

### **Data Models Subsystem** (`/schemas/`, `/repositories/`)
**Purpose:** Data structure definitions and persistence patterns (currently minimal placeholder structure).

### **Event Communication Subsystem** (`/events/`)
**Purpose:** Handles population-related event publishing and integration with other systems (currently minimal placeholder structure).

## 2. Business Logic in Simple Terms

### **Population Management** (`PopulationService`)
**What it does:** Manages the basic lifecycle of population records - creating new settlements, updating their details, tracking their status, and providing statistics about how many settlements exist.

**Why it matters:** This is the foundation that lets the game track settlements and their people. Without this, there would be no way to know which towns exist, how many people live there, or what's happening to them.

### **War Impact Calculations** (`calculate_war_impact`)
**What it does:** When war breaks out, this calculates how many people die, how many become refugees, and how badly the infrastructure gets damaged. It considers how intense the war is, how long it lasts, and how well the settlement can defend itself.

**Why it matters:** War should have realistic consequences on settlements. A major siege should devastate a town, while a minor skirmish might barely affect it. This creates believable consequences for conflict.

### **Catastrophe Effects** (`calculate_catastrophe_impact`)
**What it does:** When disasters strike (earthquakes, plagues, famines, magical events), this determines the death toll, number of displaced people, injuries, and recovery time. Different disaster types have different impact patterns.

**Why it matters:** Natural disasters and magical catastrophes should feel impactful and create interesting challenges. A plague spreads differently than an earthquake, and the system reflects these differences.

### **Resource Management** (`handle_resource_shortage`)
**What it does:** When settlements run short on critical resources like food or water, this calculates how many people die or migrate away. The severity depends on how critical the resource is and how long the shortage lasts.

**Why it matters:** Settlements need resources to survive. This creates pressure for players to maintain trade routes and resource production, making the economic game meaningful.

### **Migration Patterns** (`handle_migration`)
**What it does:** People move between settlements based on "push factors" (war, famine) that drive them away and "pull factors" (jobs, safety) that attract them to new places. Distance affects how likely people are to move.

**Why it matters:** Population should feel dynamic and responsive. People flee danger and seek opportunities, creating realistic demographic shifts that affect settlement viability.

### **Demographic Analysis** (`DemographicAnalysisService`)
**What it does:** Analyzes the age structure of populations, calculates birth and death rates by age group, predicts future population changes, and models settlement growth patterns.

**Why it matters:** Different age groups behave differently - children don't work, elderly need more medical care, adults have children. This creates realistic population dynamics beyond simple growth numbers.

### **State Transitions** (`transition_population_state`)
**What it does:** Settlements transition between states (growing, stable, declining, critical) based on their population levels and recent events. It validates that transitions make sense and aren't happening too rapidly.

**Why it matters:** Settlements should evolve believably over time. A thriving city shouldn't suddenly become a ghost town without cause, and the system enforces realistic progression patterns.

### **Seasonal Effects** (`calculate_seasonal_growth_modifier`)
**What it does:** Population growth and death rates change with the seasons. Spring typically sees more births, winter sees more deaths, and the effects vary by climate type.

**Why it matters:** Seasonal variation makes the world feel more alive and creates natural cycles that affect planning. Players need to prepare for harsh winters or take advantage of productive growing seasons.

## 3. Integration with Broader Codebase

### **API Layer Integration**
- **Population Router** (`backend/infrastructure/api/population/router.py`): Exposes HTTP endpoints that allow external systems and the Unity frontend to interact with population data
- **Demographic Router** (`backend/infrastructure/api/population/demographic_router.py`): Provides specialized endpoints for demographic analysis and projections

**Impact:** Changes to service methods directly affect API responses. New functionality requires corresponding API endpoints to be usable by the frontend.

### **Event System Integration**
- **Regional Events** (`backend/systems/region/events/region_events.py`): Population changes trigger region-wide events that other systems can listen to
- **Canonical Events** (`backend/infrastructure/events/events/canonical_events.py`): Population changes publish standardized events across the entire system

**Impact:** Population changes cascade throughout the game world, affecting faction relationships, economic conditions, and narrative events.

### **Faction System Integration**  
- **Territory Service** (`backend/systems/faction/services/territory_service.py`): Faction-controlled territories respond to population changes and can influence population dynamics
- **Alliance Service**: Population data affects diplomatic relationships and faction interactions

**Impact:** Population changes in faction territories affect political stability and can trigger diplomatic events or military responses.

### **Dialogue System Integration**
- **Population Integration** (`backend/systems/dialogue/services/population_integration.py`): NPCs in dialogue can reference local demographics, recent migrations, and social conditions
- **Missing Dependency**: References `PopulationManager` which doesn't exist, causing integration failures

**Impact:** Population dynamics should inform NPC conversations, making dialogue feel responsive to world conditions. Currently broken due to missing component.

### **Chaos System Integration**
- **Pressure Monitor** (`backend/systems/chaos/core/pressure_monitor.py`): Uses population stress factors to generate chaos pressure that can trigger random events

**Impact:** High population stress increases the likelihood of chaotic events like riots, plagues, or social unrest.

### **State Management Integration**
- **Population State Utils** (`backend/infrastructure/shared/state/population_state_utils.py`): Provides shared state transition logic used by multiple systems

**Impact:** Changes to state transition rules affect how all systems interpret population health and stability.

## 4. Maintenance Concerns

### **Duplicate Function Implementations**
**Critical Issue:** Multiple identical or near-identical functions exist across different utility files:

- `calculate_war_impact` exists in both `utils.py` and `population_utils.py` with different signatures and logic
- `calculate_catastrophe_impact` duplicated across the same files with different parameters  
- `calculate_resource_shortage_impact` and `calculate_migration_impact` also duplicated
- `calculate_seasonal_growth_modifier` and `calculate_seasonal_death_rate_modifier` duplicated

**Risk:** Changes made to one version won't be reflected in the other, causing inconsistent behavior depending on which import path is used. The service layer imports from different utilities inconsistently.

### **Missing Dependencies**
**Critical Issue:** Several imports reference non-existent files:
- `PopulationManager` imported in dialogue system but doesn't exist anywhere in the codebase
- `backend/systems/shared/database.py` referenced in startup but missing (from error logs)
- Some imports use relative paths that may break during refactoring

**Risk:** System failures during initialization and integration attempts with other systems.

### **Inconsistent Import Patterns**
**Medium Issue:** The service layer uses dynamic imports within functions rather than top-level imports:
```python
# Inside functions:
from backend.systems.population.utils import calculate_war_impact
```
This is done to avoid circular imports but makes dependencies unclear and harder to track.

### **No TODO/FIXME Comments Found**
**Good News:** The codebase appears well-maintained with no outstanding TODO comments or obvious placeholder code.

### **Complex State Validation Logic**
**Medium Issue:** State transition validation is scattered across multiple functions (`is_valid_transition`, `is_valid_state_progression`) with complex interdependencies that could be difficult to maintain.

## 5. Modular Cleanup Opportunities

### **Configuration Data to JSON**

**Move War Impact Configurations to JSON:**
Currently war impact calculations use hardcoded values scattered throughout the code:
```python
# Current hardcoded values
base_mortality_rate = war_intensity * 0.3  # Up to 30% base mortality
duration_factor = 1.0 + (duration_days / 365.0) * 0.5  # +50% per year
```

**Recommended:** Create `data/systems/population/population_config.json`:
```json
{
  "war_impact": {
    "base_mortality_multiplier": 0.3,
    "duration_yearly_bonus": 0.5,
    "max_mortality_cap": 0.8,
    "refugee_percentage": 0.4
  },
  "catastrophe_impacts": {
    "earthquake": {"mortality": 0.15, "displacement": 0.4, "injury": 0.25},
    "flood": {"mortality": 0.08, "displacement": 0.6, "injury": 0.15}
  }
}
```

**Benefits:** Game designers could tune war deadliness, disaster impacts, and refugee rates without needing programmer involvement. Balancing different disaster types becomes a content task rather than a code change.

**Move Demographic Constants to JSON:**
Age-based mortality multipliers, fertility curves, and life expectancy factors are hardcoded:
```python
age_mortality_multipliers = {
    AgeGroup.INFANT: 15.0,
    AgeGroup.CHILD: 0.5,
    AgeGroup.ADOLESCENT: 0.8
}
```

**Recommended:** Create `data/systems/population/demographic_constants.json` with age curves, seasonal modifiers, and settlement type parameters.

**Benefits:** Demographers or game designers could adjust population realism without code changes. Different fantasy settings could use different demographic profiles easily.

**Move Settlement Growth Rules to JSON:**
Settlement type transitions and carrying capacity rules are currently embedded in functions:
```python
if current_population < 500:
    settlement_type = SettlementType.VILLAGE
elif current_population < 2000:
    settlement_type = SettlementType.TOWN
```

**Recommended:** Extract settlement progression rules, resource consumption rates, and growth modifiers into configuration files.

**Benefits:** Level designers could define custom settlement types or modify how settlements grow and evolve. Different regions could have different growth patterns based on terrain or culture.

### **State Machine Configuration**
The population state transition logic could be moved to a JSON state machine definition, making it easier for designers to define new states or modify transition conditions without touching code.

### **Resource Impact Tables**
Resource shortage impacts vary by resource type but are hardcoded. Moving these to JSON would allow content creators to define new resource types and their criticality levels easily.
