## Integration Challenges & Solutions

### 1. SQLAlchemy Table Conflicts

**Issue:** The main Visual DM application has existing table definitions that conflict with our equipment system models.

**Solutions:**

#### Option A: Table Prefixing
```python
# Modify our models to use prefixed table names
class EquipmentInstance(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'equipment_instances'  # Keep existing
    
class Character(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'equipment_characters'  # Rename to avoid conflicts
```

#### Option B: Schema Separation
```python
# Use different schemas/namespaces
class EquipmentInstance(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'instances'
    __table_args__ = {'schema': 'equipment'}
```

#### Option C: Independent Database
```python
# Equipment system uses separate database
EQUIPMENT_DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///equipment_system.db"
MAIN_DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///visual_dm.db"
```

**Recommended: Option A** - Simple prefixing avoids complexity while ensuring compatibility.

### 2. Character System Integration

**Current State:**
- Equipment system has minimal Character model for foreign key requirements
- Main Visual DM has comprehensive character system

**Integration Strategy:**

1. **Identify Character Table Structure**
   ```bash
   # Examine main character model
   grep -r "class Character" ../../
   ```

2. **Update Foreign Key References**
   ```python
   # Update equipment models to reference main character table
   owner_id = Column(String, ForeignKey('characters.id'))
   ```

3. **Character Equipment Endpoints**
   ```python
   @router.get("/characters/{character_id}/equipment")
   async def get_character_equipment(character_id: str):
       # Get all equipment for a character
   ```

### 3. Combat System Integration

**Required Integrations:**

1. **Stat Calculation Service**
   ```python
   class CombatStatsService:
       def calculate_character_stats(self, character_id: str) -> CharacterStats:
           # Include equipment bonuses in combat stats
           equipment_stats = self.equipment_service.get_character_stats(character_id)
           return base_stats + equipment_stats
   ```

2. **Equipment Durability in Combat**
   ```python
   async def process_combat_round(combat_id: str):
       # After combat calculations
       await self.equipment_service.apply_combat_degradation(character_ids)
   ```

3. **Equipment Abilities in Combat**
   ```python
   # Equipment provides special abilities usable in combat
   available_abilities = await equipment_service.get_equipment_abilities(character_id)
   ```

## Phase-by-Phase Integration Plan

### Phase 1: Database Integration (Week 1)

**Goals:**
- Resolve SQLAlchemy conflicts
- Integrate with main database
- Ensure equipment tables work alongside existing tables

**Tasks:**
1. **Analyze Main Database Schema**
   ```bash
   cd ../../
   find . -name "*.py" -exec grep -l "class.*Base" {} \;
   # Identify all existing models
   ```

2. **Rename Conflicting Tables**
   ```python
   # Update our models with prefixed names
   __tablename__ = 'equipment_instances'
   __tablename__ = 'equipment_quality_tiers'
   # etc.
   ```

3. **Update Foreign Key References**
   ```python
   # Point to actual character table
   character_id = Column(String, ForeignKey('main_characters.id'))
   ```

4. **Create Migration Scripts**
   ```python
   # Alembic migrations for equipment tables
   alembic init equipment_migrations
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add equipment system"
   ```

5. **Test Integration**
   ```python
   # Test equipment operations with main database
   python test_main_integration.py
   ```

### Phase 2: API Integration (Week 2)

**Goals:**
- Mount equipment router in main FastAPI app
- Ensure session management compatibility
- Test all API endpoints

**Tasks:**
1. **Update Main FastAPI App**
   ```python
   # In main.py
   from systems.equipment.routers import equipment_router
   app.include_router(equipment_router, prefix="/api/equipment", tags=["equipment"])
   ```

2. **Session Management**
   ```python
   # Ensure equipment endpoints use main app's session management
   from main_app.dependencies import get_db_session
   ```

3. **CORS and Middleware**
   ```python
   # Ensure equipment endpoints work with existing middleware
   ```

4. **API Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test all equipment endpoints through main app
   pytest tests/integration/test_equipment_api.py
   ```

### Phase 3: Character Integration (Week 3)

**Goals:**
- Character profiles show equipment
- Equipment creation from character sheet
- Character stats include equipment bonuses

**Tasks:**
1. **Character Equipment Tab**
   ```javascript
   // Frontend: Add equipment tab to character sheet
   <CharacterEquipment characterId={characterId} />
   ```

2. **Stat Integration Service**
   ```python
   class CharacterStatsService:
       def __init__(self):
           self.equipment_service = HybridEquipmentService()
           
       def get_total_stats(self, character_id: str):
           base_stats = self.get_base_stats(character_id)
           equipment_stats = self.equipment_service.get_character_equipment_stats(character_id)
           return self.combine_stats(base_stats, equipment_stats)
   ```

3. **Equipment Assignment**
   ```python
   # Allow creating equipment directly for characters
   @router.post("/characters/{character_id}/equipment")
   async def create_character_equipment(character_id: str, template_id: str):
       pass
   ```

### Phase 4: Combat Integration (Week 4)

**Goals:**
- Equipment stats affect combat
- Combat degrades equipment durability
- Equipment abilities usable in combat

**Tasks:**
1. **Combat Stat Calculation**
   ```python
   # Update combat calculations to include equipment
   def calculate_attack_power(character_id: str):
       base_attack = get_character_base_attack(character_id)
       equipment_bonus = equipment_service.get_attack_bonus(character_id)
       return base_attack + equipment_bonus
   ```

2. **Durability Management**
   ```python
   # After each combat round
   async def post_combat_maintenance(participants: List[str]):
       for character_id in participants:
           await equipment_service.apply_combat_degradation(character_id)
   ```

3. **Equipment Abilities**
   ```python
   # Equipment can provide special combat abilities
   class EquipmentAbility:
       def can_use_in_combat(self, combat_context: CombatContext) -> bool:
           pass
           
       def execute(self, target: str) -> CombatEffect:
           pass
   ```

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Week 5)

**Goals:**
- Crafting system integration
- Loot generation system
- Equipment trading between characters

**Tasks:**
1. **Crafting Integration**
   ```python
   # Crafting creates equipment instances
   def craft_equipment(recipe_id: str, materials: Dict, crafter_skill: int):
       quality = determine_quality_from_skill(crafter_skill)
       return equipment_service.create_from_template(recipe_id, quality=quality)
   ```

2. **Loot Generation**
   ```python
   # Generate random equipment as loot
   def generate_loot(encounter_level: int, loot_type: str):
       templates = get_appropriate_templates(encounter_level)
       return [create_random_equipment(template) for template in templates]
   ```

3. **Equipment Trading**
   ```python
   # Transfer equipment between characters
   def transfer_equipment(equipment_id: str, from_character: str, to_character: str):
       pass
   ```

   ```

2. **Database Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Rollback equipment migrations
   alembic downgrade head-1
   ```

### Gradual Rollback
1. **Feature Flags**
   ```python
   # Use feature flags to enable/disable equipment features
   if feature_flags.EQUIPMENT_SYSTEM_ENABLED:
       app.include_router(equipment_router)
   ```
