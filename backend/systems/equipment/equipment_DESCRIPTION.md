# Equipment System Analysis Report

## 1. Logical Subsystems

The Equipment System is divided into the following logical subsystems:

### **Quality Management Subsystem**
- **Location**: `backend/systems/equipment/models/equipment_quality.py`
- **Purpose**: Manages different quality tiers (Basic, Military, Noble) for equipment, including durability periods, repair costs, value multipliers, and visual representations

### **Durability Management Subsystem**
- **Location**: `backend/systems/equipment/services/durability_service.py`
- **Purpose**: Handles time-based equipment degradation, wear calculations, repair mechanics, and durability status tracking

### **Infrastructure Layer**
- **Location**: `backend/infrastructure/systems/equipment/`
- **Purpose**: Provides the foundational data models, database entities, and utility functions that support the business logic
- **Components**:
  - **Models**: Core data structures for equipment entities, durability logs, and equipment sets
  - **Services**: Basic CRUD operations for equipment management
  - **Utilities**: Set bonus calculations, durability operations, inventory integration, and item identification

### **Business Logic Layer (Deprecated/Transitional)**
- **Location**: `backend/systems/equipment/`
- **Purpose**: Contains business-specific logic and serves as backward compatibility layer during system reorganization
- **Components**:
  - **Events**: Placeholder for equipment-related events (currently empty)
  - **Schemas**: Placeholder for API schemas (currently empty)
  - **Repositories**: Placeholder for data access patterns (currently empty)
  - **Routers**: Placeholder for API endpoints (currently empty)

## 2. Business Logic in Simple Terms

### **Equipment Quality System**
**What it does**: Defines three tiers of equipment quality that affect how long items last and how much they cost to maintain.

**Why it matters**: Players need different options for their budget and play style. A basic sword might break after a week but only costs 500 gold to repair, while a noble sword lasts a month but costs 1,500 gold to repair.

**Key Rules**:
- Basic quality items last 1 week of normal use
- Military quality items last 2 weeks and cost 1.5x more to repair
- Noble quality items last 4 weeks but cost 3x more to repair
- Higher quality items are worth more (Military = 3x value, Noble = 6x value)
- Each quality tier has different visual sprites for the game

### **Equipment Rarity and Abilities System**
**What it does**: Every piece of equipment in Visual DM is inherently magical and contains multiple hidden abilities that unlock as players level up or pay for identification.

**Why it matters**: Creates ongoing discovery and progression where gear evolves with the character. No equipment is "mundane" - everything has magical potential waiting to be unlocked.

**Key Rules**:
- **Common Rarity**: Contains 3-5 abilities, drops 50% of the time
- **Rare Rarity**: Contains 5-10 abilities, drops 0.25% of the time (1/400) 
- **Epic Rarity**: Contains 10-15 abilities, drops extremely rarely
- **Legendary Rarity**: Contains 20+ abilities, drops 0.0025% of the time (1/40,000), drawn from larger ability pool

**Identification System**:
- Players can pay NPCs to identify items up to their current character level
- When a player levels up while wearing equipment, it automatically becomes identified up to that new level
- Hidden abilities remain unknown until identified or through leveling
- Standard vendors reveal one effect at a time for a fee
- Legendary NPCs can reveal all effects for a significant price
- Equipment shows its rarity type but not specific bonuses until identified

**Item Evolution**:
- Items "grow" with the character through level-gated effect unlocking
- More powerful items have more potential as characters advance
- Creates long-term attachment to gear rather than constant replacement

### **Durability Service**
**What it does**: Simulates realistic wear and tear on equipment over time, making items degrade and eventually break if not maintained.

**Why it matters**: Creates ongoing economic decisions for players about when to repair, replace, or upgrade equipment. Adds realism where heavily-used gear needs maintenance.

**Key Rules**:
- Equipment loses durability daily based on its quality tier
- Combat causes additional damage (weapons take 0.5 damage per hit, armor takes 0.2 when hit)
- Critical hits double the durability damage
- Environmental factors (weather, terrain) can increase wear rates
- Equipment below 50% durability provides reduced stat bonuses
- Equipment below 10% durability is "broken" and provides no benefits
- Repair costs scale based on damage severity (very damaged items cost 50% more to repair)

### **Set Bonus Utilities**
**What it does**: Rewards players for wearing multiple pieces of matching equipment by providing additional bonuses.

**Why it matters**: Encourages players to collect complete sets rather than mixing random pieces, creating collection goals and strategic equipment choices.

**Key Rules**:
- Equipment sets are defined with specific item IDs that belong together
- Wearing 2 pieces might give +5 strength, wearing 4 pieces might add special effects
- Bonuses are calculated dynamically whenever equipment changes
- Set bonuses can include both stat increases and special abilities

### **Infrastructure Services**
**What it does**: Provides the basic database operations for creating, reading, updating, and deleting equipment records.

**Why it matters**: These are the fundamental building blocks that other systems use to interact with equipment data.

## 3. Integration with Broader Codebase

### **Dependencies (What This System Needs)**
- **Inventory System**: Equipment relies on the inventory system to verify item ownership, provide base item properties, and handle item storage
- **Database Infrastructure**: Uses SQLAlchemy models and database sessions for persistence
- **Character System**: Equipment affects character stats and must integrate with character data
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Uses common base models, exceptions, and services from the shared infrastructure layer

### **Dependents (What Uses This System)**
- **Combat System**: Relies on equipment stats for damage calculations and durability damage
- **Character System**: Equipment bonuses and set effects modify character attributes
- **Crafting System**: Creates new equipment items that feed into this system
- **Shop/Economy System**: Equipment values and repair costs integrate with the game economy
- **Magic System**: Equipment can have magical properties and effects

### **Event Integration**
The system follows an event-driven architecture where equipment changes trigger events that other systems can respond to. For example, when equipment breaks, it might trigger notifications to the player or affect combat calculations.

### **API Integration**
Equipment operations are exposed through REST APIs that allow other systems and the frontend to:
- Equip and unequip items
- Check equipment stats and durability
- Calculate repair costs
- Manage equipment sets
- Apply durability damage

## 4. Maintenance Concerns

### **Missing Implementation**
The current system has several placeholder components:
- **Events module is empty**: No event handling is implemented yet
- **Schemas module is empty**: No API request/response schemas defined
- **Repositories module is empty**: No data access patterns implemented
- **Routers module is empty**: No API endpoints defined

### **Architecture Transition Issues**
The system appears to be in the middle of a reorganization:
- Business logic is being moved from `backend/systems/equipment/` to `backend/infrastructure/systems/equipment/`
- The old models module redirects to infrastructure but includes deprecation warnings
- This could cause confusion during development about which modules to use

### **Missing Advanced Features**
Several features mentioned in the documentation are not yet implemented:
- Advanced requirements validation (class, level, quest completion requirements)
- Equipment effects management (temporary buffs, proc effects)
- Slot conflict resolution (two-handed weapons blocking off-hand slots)
- Equipment synergy systems
- Visual representation hooks
- Equipment rating calculations

### **Database Dependency Issues**
Several utility modules have fallback logic for when database imports fail, suggesting potential import or configuration issues that could cause silent failures.

## 5. Opportunities for Modular Cleanup

### **Configuration Files**
The following hard-coded values should be moved to JSON configuration files:

**Equipment Quality Configuration** (`equipment_quality_config.json`):
```json
{
  "quality_tiers": {
    "basic": {
      "durability_weeks": 1,
      "repair_cost_multiplier": 1.0,
      "value_multiplier": 1.0,
      "sprite_suffix": "_basic"
    },
    "military": {
      "durability_weeks": 2,
      "repair_cost_multiplier": 1.5,
      "value_multiplier": 3.0,
      "sprite_suffix": "_military"
    },
    "noble": {
      "durability_weeks": 4,
      "repair_cost_multiplier": 3.0,
      "value_multiplier": 6.0,
      "sprite_suffix": "_noble"
    }
  },
  "base_repair_cost": 500
}
```

**Durability Configuration** (`durability_config.json`):
```json
{
  "durability_thresholds": {
    "excellent": 90.0,
    "good": 75.0,
    "worn": 50.0,
    "damaged": 25.0,
    "very_damaged": 10.0,
    "broken": 0.0
  },
  "combat_damage_base": {
    "weapon": 0.5,
    "armor": 0.2,
    "shield": 0.3,
    "accessory": 0.1
  },
  "stat_penalties": {
    "worn": 0.1,
    "damaged": 0.25,
    "very_damaged": 0.5
  },
  "severity_multipliers": {
    "very_damaged_threshold": 0.9,
    "heavily_damaged_threshold": 0.7,
    "very_damaged_multiplier": 1.5,
    "heavily_damaged_multiplier": 1.25
  }
}
```

**Equipment Set Templates** (`equipment_sets.json`):
```json
{
  "template_sets": [
    {
      "name": "Dragon Slayer Set",
      "description": "Powerful set for dragon hunters",
      "set_bonuses": {
        "2": {
          "stats": {"strength": 5},
          "effects": [{"name": "Fire Resistance"}]
        },
        "4": {
          "stats": {"strength": 10, "vitality": 10},
          "effects": [{"name": "Dragon Slayer"}]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Benefits of JSON Configuration**
1. **Non-programmer Modification**: Game designers can tweak durability rates, repair costs, and set bonuses without touching code
2. **Easy Balancing**: Values can be adjusted and tested without redeployment
3. **Environment-Specific Settings**: Different configurations for development, testing, and production
4. **Rapid Iteration**: Equipment balance changes can be made quickly during playtesting
5. **Localization Support**: Equipment names and descriptions can be externalized for multiple languages

### **Recommended Cleanup Steps**
1. Extract all configuration constants to JSON files
2. Implement the missing placeholder modules (events, schemas, repositories, routers)
3. Complete the architecture migration to infrastructure layer
4. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
5. Implement the missing advanced features mentioned in the documentation
6. Create proper API documentation for all equipment operations 

## 6. Planned Enchanting/Disenchanting System Design

### **Philosophy and Integration**
The enchanting system integrates with Visual DM's existing abilities-based equipment system. Since all equipment already contains multiple abilities, enchanting focuses on transferring abilities between items rather than adding magic to mundane gear.

### **Enchantment Learning System**
**Core Concept**: Players must disenchant items to learn their abilities, then can apply those learned abilities to other equipment.

**Key Components**:
- **Ability Library**: Tracks learned abilities and their mastery levels from disenchanted items
- **Discovery Source Tracking**: Records which item each ability was learned from
- **Skill-Based Progression**: Integration with abilities system (7 at level 1, +3 per level)
- **Risk/Reward Mechanics**: Failed disenchanting destroys items unless high skill level

### **Enchanting Skill Progression**
**Abilities System Integration** (No Classes):
- Characters start with 7 abilities at level 1, gain 3 additional abilities per level
- Enchanting abilities have prerequisites and form skill trees
- Higher skill levels reduce failure chances when disenchanting
- Certain abilities specifically help with enchanting success rates
- Skill progression through Craft (INT) subskill: Enchanting

### **Enchanting Infrastructure**
**Repair Station Integration**:
- Enchanting performed at existing repair stations with appropriate capabilities
- Different station types may have different success rate bonuses
- Higher-tier stations reduce risk for complex enchanting operations

**Professional Services**:
- Players can pay NPCs for 100% guaranteed enchanting success at exorbitant costs
- Creates economic choice between risk/reward of DIY vs. guaranteed professional service
- Legendary NPCs might offer unique enchanting services unavailable elsewhere

### **Rarity-Based Ability Pools**
**Common Equipment (3-5 abilities)**:
- Simple abilities (+1 damage, basic resistances)
- Low disenchanting risk, common materials required for transfer

**Rare Equipment (5-10 abilities)**:
- Moderate abilities (skill bonuses, situational effects)
- Higher material costs, moderate skill requirements

**Epic Equipment (10-15 abilities)**:
- Powerful abilities (significant combat effects, utility powers)
- High risk/cost to disenchant, requires advanced skills

**Legendary Equipment (20+ abilities)**:
- Unique abilities unavailable elsewhere, drawn from expanded ability pool
- Extremely high risk/cost to disenchant
- Source of the most powerful and unique effects
- May include monster-only abilities not normally available to players

### **Equipment Set Detection - Semantic Approach**
**Replaces Fuzzy Logic**: Uses AI-driven semantic similarity for set detection
- **Thematic Tags**: GPT generates semantic tags during equipment creation (`["draconic", "flame", "ancient"]`)
- **Dynamic Set Discovery**: Sets emerge from thematic coherence rather than pre-defined lists
- **Embedding Similarity**: Uses sentence transformers (already in dialogue system) for clustering
- **AI Validation**: LLM validates set coherence and generates appropriate bonuses

### **Set Composition and Mechanics**
**Set Components**: **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION - WEAPONS + ARMOR OR ARMOR ONLY?]**

**Set Bonus Progression**:
- **Exponential Scaling**: More pieces equipped = exponentially better effects
- **Discourages Mixing**: Single complete sets provide better individual bonuses than mixing multiple partial sets
- **Variety Trade-off**: Mixing sets gives more different types of bonuses but weaker individual effects

**Set Visibility**:
- **Hidden Bonuses**: Specific set effects remain hidden until the set is actively equipped
- **Set Type Visible**: Players can see the thematic "type" of set pieces
- **Conflicting Set Penalties**: Visible before equipping, creates strategic choices

### **Integration Points**

**With Quality/Durability System**:
- Quality tier may affect enchantment success rates and stability
- Enchanting does NOT affect durability degradation rates
- Higher quality equipment may hold transferred abilities more effectively

**With Economy System**:
- Disenchanting costs scale exponentially with rarity
- Creates specialized enchanting economy sector
- Materials market driven by enchanting demand
- Professional enchanting services create high-end economy

**With Repair Station Infrastructure**:
- Enchanting performed at existing repair stations
- Different station capabilities affect success rates and available operations
- Station upgrades unlock more complex enchanting possibilities

### **Weirdness Prevention Strategies**
1. **Thematic Coherence Validation**: AI ensures ability combinations make narrative sense
2. **Set Limitation**: Maximum 2-3 active sets to prevent equipment overload
3. **Conflicting Set Penalties**: Thematically opposed sets provide negative interactions
4. **Ability Source Validation**: Only abilities that exist in the item_effects.json can be transferred

### **Implementation Requirements**
1. **Complete Equipment Infrastructure**: Events, schemas, repositories, routers modules
2. **Ability Transfer Database Models**: Track learned abilities and their sources
3. **Semantic Set Detection Service**: AI-powered thematic clustering using existing dialogue infrastructure
4. **Enchanting API Endpoints**: Player interface for enchanting operations at repair stations
5. **Integration Services**: Connect with abilities system, economy, and repair stations
6. **Configuration Data**: JSON files for ability pools, success rates, and costs
7. **Professional Services System**: NPC enchanting services with guaranteed success

### **Benefits of This Approach**
- **Meaningful Choices**: Must sacrifice valuable items to gain enchanting knowledge
- **Progressive Power**: Legendary abilities require legendary sacrifices
- **Economic Integration**: Creates ongoing material and service demands
- **Skill Progression**: Integrates with existing abilities system (7+3/level)
- **Risk Management**: High-skill players can reduce risk, or pay for guaranteed success
- **Anti-Exploitation**: High costs and destruction risk prevent ability farming
- **Equipment Evolution**: Enhances existing ability-based equipment system rather than replacing it
