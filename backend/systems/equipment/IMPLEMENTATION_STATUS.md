   - Equipment stats calculation
   - Basic compatibility checks

2. **Item Identification**
   - Progressive item identification system
   - Identification cost calculation
   - Full identification via special NPCs
   - Item name and property revelation

3. **Shop Integration**
   - Shop inventory restocking
   - Shop-specific item generation
   - Shop inventory retrieval

4. **Equipment Set Bonuses** ✅
   - Equipment set definition model
   - Set bonus calculation
   - Scalable bonuses (2-piece, 4-piece, etc.)
   - Stat bonuses and special effects
   - Dynamic recalculation on equipment changes
   - Full CRUD API for equipment sets

5. **Durability System** ✅
   - Equipment durability tracking
   - Combat damage calculation
   - Wear and tear damage over time
   - Environmental factors affecting durability
   - Repair mechanics with variable costs
   - Equipment breaking when durability reaches zero
   - Durability effects on item stats
   - Historical tracking of durability changes
   - API endpoints for all durability operations

## Features Still to Implement

1. **Advanced Requirements Validation**
   - Class requirements
   - Level requirements
   - More detailed stat requirements
   - Special requirements (quest completion, faction standing)

2. **Equipment Effects Management**
   - Temporary buffs/debuffs from equipment
   - Timed effects (activate on specific conditions)
   - Proc effects (chance on hit, etc.)
   - Environmental effects

3. **Slot Conflict Resolution**
   - Two-handed weapons blocking off-hand slot
   - Armor type exclusivity
   - Set-specific slot variations

4. **Equipment Synergy System**
   - Item compatibility bonus/penalties
   - Cross-set synergies
   - Material synergies

5. **Visual Representation Hooks**
   - Equipment appearance data
   - Visual model switching
   - Animation modification based on equipment

6. **Equipment Rating Calculation**
   - Overall gear score calculation
   - Comparison to baseline/optimal scores
   - Item rarity influence on rating
   - Class-specific item scoring

## Implementation Plan

The next feature to implement should be the Advanced Requirements Validation system, as it will enhance the equipment system by enabling more detailed and varied equipment requirements.

## Integration with Development Bible

The equipment system as outlined here follows the event-driven architecture described in the Development Bible. All features are implemented as services that emit events through the central event dispatcher, enabling loose coupling with other systems while maintaining clear responsibility boundaries.

Future extensions, such as the religion and diplomacy systems, will be able to interact with the equipment system through the standardized event interfaces.

## Recent Updates

### Durability System Implementation (2023-05-25)

Added a comprehensive durability system that includes:

- Database models for tracking durability and durability history
- Combat and wear damage calculation
- Dynamic stat adjustment based on durability status
- Full repair functionality with cost calculation
- API endpoints for all durability operations
- Integration with equipment stats calculation

This implementation follows the event-driven architecture outlined in the Development Bible, with clear separation of concerns and standardized interfaces.
