# Weather System

A comprehensive weather system for the Visual DM tabletop RPG project, fully compliant with the Development Bible standards.

## Overview

The weather system provides dynamic weather simulation with realistic transitions, seasonal variations, and rich frontend integration through visual/audio effects data. The system has been completely refactored to follow clean architecture principles with proper separation of concerns.

## Architecture

The weather system follows the Development Bible's layered architecture:

## Key Features

### Business Logic
- **Seasonal Weather Generation**: Different weather patterns for spring, summer, autumn, and winter
- **Realistic Transitions**: Weather changes follow logical progression patterns
- **Time-Based Duration**: Weather conditions have realistic duration before changing
- **Force Weather**: Admin capability to override weather for events/campaigns
- **Weather Forecasting**: Predictive weather generation for planning

### Frontend Integration
- **Visual Effects Data**: Skybox tints, particle effects, fog density, lighting adjustments
- **Audio Effects Data**: Ambient loops, random sounds, intensity levels
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live weather changes
- **Configuration Access**: Frontend can access weather types and configuration

### Data Management
- **Persistent Weather State**: Current weather persists across server restarts
- **Weather History**: Track weather changes over time (limited to 1000 entries)
- **Configuration-Driven**: JSON-based weather types and system configuration
- **Validation**: Robust input validation and error handling

## API Endpoints

All endpoints are available under `/api/weather/`:

- `GET /current` - Get current weather with effects data
- `GET /forecast?hours=24&season=spring` - Get weather forecast
- `GET /history?limit=50` - Get weather history
- `POST /advance?season=spring&hours_elapsed=1` - Advance weather (game progression)
- `POST /force?condition=rain&duration_hours=2` - Force specific weather (admin)
- `GET /conditions` - Get available weather conditions
- `GET /config` - Get weather system configuration

## Configuration Files

### Weather Types (`data/systems/weather/weather_types.json`)
Defines all available weather conditions with:
- Display names and descriptions
- Temperature and visibility modifiers
- Seasonal probability weights
- Transition rules (which conditions can change to which)
- Visual effects (skybox tints, particles, fog)
- Audio effects (ambient sounds, random effects)

### Weather Configuration (`data/systems/weather/weather_config.json`)
System-wide settings including:
- Weather system enabled/disabled
- Update frequency and randomness factors
- Default weather conditions
- Seasonal temperature ranges
- Event integration settings

## Event System Integration

The weather system integrates with the game's event system:

### Listens For:
- `time_advanced` - Automatically advance weather based on game time progression
- `season_changed` - Adjust weather patterns for new season
- `admin_weather_force` - Admin-triggered weather changes

### Emits:
- `weather_changed` - When weather conditions change, includes full weather and effects data

## Business Rules

### Weather Transitions
- Weather changes based on current condition's `can_transition_to` rules
- Seasonal influence affects probability of different conditions
- Duration-based changes occur when current weather's time expires
- Random early changes can occur based on system randomness factor

### Seasonal Patterns
- **Spring**: Balanced mix with frequent rain, moderate temperatures
- **Summer**: Clear skies favored, higher temperatures, occasional storms
- **Autumn**: Cloudier conditions, cooler temperatures, frequent rain
- **Winter**: Snow conditions, coldest temperatures, occasional blizzards

### Temperature Calculation
- Base temperature determined by seasonal ranges
- Weather-specific modifiers applied (rain cools, clear weather warms)
- Realistic bounds maintained (winter snow vs summer heat)

## Usage Examples

### Get Current Weather
```python
from backend.systems.weather.services.weather_service import weather_service

current = weather_service.get_current_weather()
print(f"Current: {current['condition']} at {current['temperature']}°F")
```

### Advance Time (Game Integration)
```python
# Game time advances 4 hours in summer
event_data = {"hours_elapsed": 4, "season": "summer"}
new_weather = weather_service.handle_time_advance_event(event_data)
```

### Force Weather (Admin)
```python
# Force thunderstorm for dramatic effect
forced = weather_service.force_weather_change("thunderstorm", duration_hours=1)
```

### API Usage
```bash
# Get current weather
curl http://localhost:8000/api/weather/current

# Force fog for 3 hours
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/weather/force?condition=fog&duration_hours=3"

# Get 48-hour forecast for winter
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/weather/forecast?hours=48&season=winter"
```

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite covering all components:

```bash
# Run all weather system tests
cd backend/systems/weather/tests
python test_runner.py

# Run specific test class
python test_runner.py --class TestWeatherBusinessService

# Run with coverage reporting
python test_runner.py --coverage

# Run specific test method
python test_runner.py --class TestWeatherEventHandler --method test_handle_time_advanced_calls_advance_weather
```

### Test Coverage
- **Business Logic**: Core weather generation, transitions, seasonal patterns
- **Repository**: Data persistence, history management, error handling  
- **Validation**: Configuration loading, input validation, fallback handling
- **Event Handling**: Game event integration, event data formatting
- **API Endpoints**: HTTP request/response handling, parameter validation, error cases

## Dependency Injection

The system uses protocol-based dependency injection throughout:

```python
# Business service depends on abstractions, not implementations
class WeatherBusinessService:
    def __init__(self, 
                 weather_repository: WeatherRepository,      # Protocol
                 validation_service: WeatherValidationService): # Protocol
        # ...

# Easy to mock for testing
mock_repo = Mock(spec=WeatherRepository)
mock_validation = Mock(spec=WeatherValidationService)
service = WeatherBusinessService(mock_repo, mock_validation)
```

## Error Handling

Robust error handling at all layers:
- **Validation**: Invalid weather conditions default to "clear"
- **Configuration**: Missing JSON files use hardcoded fallbacks
- **Persistence**: Failed saves/loads are handled gracefully
- **API**: All endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes
- **Business Logic**: Boundary conditions and edge cases covered

## Performance Considerations

- **Configuration Caching**: JSON files cached after first load
- **History Management**: Weather history capped at 1000 entries
- **Efficient Transitions**: O(1) weather condition lookups
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only essential external dependencies

## Legacy Compatibility

The `WeatherService` class provides a facade for backward compatibility:
- Maintains existing API contract
- Translates between old and new data formats
- Allows gradual migration of existing code
- No breaking changes to current integrations

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for extension:
- **Location-Based Weather**: Different weather for different map regions
- **Weather Events**: Special weather phenomena (meteors, aurora, etc.)
- **Player Influence**: Spells/abilities that affect weather
- **Advanced Patterns**: Multi-day weather systems, fronts, pressure systems
- **Climate Zones**: Desert, arctic, tropical climate variations
