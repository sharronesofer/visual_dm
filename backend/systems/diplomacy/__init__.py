## Usage Examples

### Basic Diplomatic Operations
```python
# Faction relationship management
relationship = diplomatic_service.get_relationship(faction_a, faction_b)
diplomatic_service.modify_relationship(faction_a, faction_b, trust_delta=10)

# Event processing
event = diplomatic_service.create_diplomatic_event(
    faction_a, faction_b, "trade_agreement_signed"
)
```

### Advanced Negotiations
```python
# AI-powered negotiation
negotiation = diplomatic_service.start_negotiation(
    initiator=faction_a,
    participants=[faction_b, faction_c],
    agenda=["trade_agreement", "military_cooperation"]
)

response = diplomatic_service.generate_ai_response(
    negotiation_id=negotiation.id,
    responding_faction=faction_b,
    message="We propose a 15% tariff reduction"
)
```

### Crisis Management
```python
# Crisis detection and management
crises = crisis_service.scan_for_crises()
for crisis in crises:
    resolution_options = crisis_service.generate_resolution_pathways(crisis.id)
    impact_assessment = crisis_service.generate_crisis_impact_assessment(crisis.id)
```

### Intelligence Operations
```python
# Agent recruitment and operations
agent = intelligence_service.recruit_agent(
    faction_id=faction_a,
    specialization=IntelligenceType.DIPLOMATIC_RECONNAISSANCE
)

operation = intelligence_service.plan_intelligence_operation(
    executing_faction=faction_a,
    target_faction=faction_b,
    operation_type=IntelligenceType.ECONOMIC_INTELLIGENCE,
    objectives=["Gather trade route intelligence", "Assess economic vulnerabilities"]
)

result, report = intelligence_service.execute_intelligence_operation(operation.id)
```

### Information Warfare
```python
# Propaganda campaigns
campaign = intelligence_service.launch_propaganda_campaign(
    executing_faction=faction_a,
    target_factions=[faction_b],
    campaign_type=InformationWarfareType.REPUTATION_ATTACK,
    primary_message="Target faction policies harm regional stability"
)

results = intelligence_service.execute_information_campaign(campaign.id)
```
