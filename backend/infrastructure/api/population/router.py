Population System - Main Router

This module combines all population system routes including the new demographic
mathematical models from Task 74, the disease modeling system, real-time
WebSocket communication for Unity integration, batch operations for 
administrative and large-scale event management, economic prosperity effects,
performance monitoring & optimization, and enhanced war impact models.
