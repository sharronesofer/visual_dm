# Alert Monitoring and Escalation System

This module provides a comprehensive solution for managing alerts and implementing clear escalation policies.

## Overview

The Alert Monitoring and Escalation System is responsible for:

1. Processing incoming alerts from various monitoring systems
2. Categorizing alerts by severity (P1-P4)
3. Applying suppression rules to avoid alert storms
4. Managing automatic recovery attempts when configured
5. Implementing escalation paths based on alert severity and timeframes
6. Sending notifications to appropriate targets via multiple channels
7. Tracking the status and history of alerts throughout their lifecycle

## Core Components

### AlertProcessor

The main entry point that orchestrates the entire alert lifecycle:

- Processing incoming alerts
- Applying suppression rules
- Attempting auto-recovery when applicable
- Coordinating between the escalation manager and notification dispatcher

### EscalationManager

Responsible for managing the escalation logic:

- Determining when alerts should be escalated
- Identifying the appropriate escalation level
- Finding the right targets for each escalation level
- Managing escalation timeframes and conditions

### NotificationDispatcher

Handles sending notifications to various channels:

- Formatting notifications based on templates
- Sending to multiple channels (Slack, Email, SMS, PagerDuty)
- Updating status pages
- Managing notification suppression and grouping

## Configuration

The system is configured via YAML files in the `config` directory:

### escalation_config.yaml

Defines:
- Global notification defaults
- Escalation timeframes for each severity level
- Role definitions and notification methods
- Escalation paths with targets, actions, and conditions
- System-specific overrides for special cases
- Auto-recovery actions and rules
- Notification suppression rules

### notification_templates.yaml

Contains templates for:
- Notifications for different channels (Slack, Email, SMS, PagerDuty)
- Templates for different severity levels
- Special templates for escalations
- Status page updates
- Auto-recovery notifications

## Usage Examples

### Basic Alert Processing

```python
from backend.core.monitoring.alert_processor import AlertProcessor

# Create an alert processor
processor = AlertProcessor()

# Process an alert
alert_data = {
    'name': 'High CPU Usage',
    'severity': 'P2',
    'system': 'web_server',
    'description': 'Web server CPU usage exceeded 90% for more than 5 minutes',
    'value': 92.5,
    'unit': '%',
    'threshold': 90
}

result = processor.process_alert(alert_data)
processed_alert = result.get('alert', {})
```

### Checking and Performing Escalations

```python
# Check if an alert should be escalated
escalation_result = processor.check_and_escalate(processed_alert)

if escalation_result.get('action') == 'escalated':
    print(f"Alert escalated to level: {escalation_result.get('level')}")
    escalated_alert = escalation_result.get('alert', {})
else:
    print(f"No escalation needed: {escalation_result.get('reason')}")
```

### Updating Alert Status

```python
# Acknowledge an alert
update_result = processor.update_alert(alert_id, {
    'status': 'acknowledged',
    'acknowledged_by': 'john.doe'
})

# Resolve an alert
update_result = processor.update_alert(alert_id, {
    'status': 'resolved',
    'resolution': 'Increased server capacity'
})
```

## Alert Escalation Workflow

1. **Initial Processing**: When an alert is received, it's processed by the `AlertProcessor`, which assigns an ID, sets the initial escalation level, and determines the initial targets for notification.

2. **Initial Notification**: Notifications are sent to the initial targets based on the alert's severity and the configured escalation path.

3. **Escalation Check**: Periodically, the system checks if alerts need to be escalated based on:
   - Time since the alert was created without acknowledgment
   - Time since the last update without resolution
   - Other configured conditions

4. **Escalation**: If an alert needs to be escalated, the escalation level is updated, new targets are determined, and escalation notifications are sent.

5. **Resolution**: When an alert is resolved (either manually or via auto-recovery), its status is updated, and it's no longer considered for escalation.

## Integration Points

The Alert Monitoring and Escalation System can be integrated with:

- Monitoring systems (Prometheus, Nagios, CloudWatch, etc.)
- Incident management platforms (JIRA, ServiceNow, etc.)
- Communication tools (Slack, Microsoft Teams, etc.)
- Paging services (PagerDuty, OpsGenie, etc.)
- Status page providers (Statuspage.io, etc.)

## Extending the System

To add support for additional notification channels:

1. Add a new handler method in `NotificationDispatcher` (e.g., `_send_teams`)
2. Add the channel to the `channel_handlers` dictionary in the constructor
3. Add templates for the new channel in `notification_templates.yaml`

To customize escalation paths:

1. Modify the `escalation_paths` section in `escalation_config.yaml`
2. Define new roles in the `roles` section if needed
3. Add system-specific overrides in the `system_overrides` section

## Integrating with Monitoring Systems

The system supports modular integration with a wide variety of monitoring platforms (e.g., Prometheus, Nagios, CloudWatch, Datadog, Zabbix, custom tools) via a standardized adapter interface. All integration adapters are located in the `integrations/` directory.

### Adapter Architecture
- Each monitoring system has its own adapter module in `backend/core/monitoring/integrations/`.
- Adapters are responsible for:
  - Receiving or polling alerts from the source system (webhook, API, SNMP, etc.)
  - Normalizing alert data to the schema expected by `AlertProcessor`
  - Handling authentication, error handling, and retries
  - Logging integration activity and failures
- Adapters should implement a common interface (see `adapter_base.py`).

### Adding a New Integration
1. Create a new adapter module in `integrations/` (e.g., `prometheus_adapter.py`).
2. Inherit from `AdapterBase` and implement required methods:
   - `fetch_alerts()` or `handle_webhook()`
   - `normalize_alert()`
3. Register the adapter in the integration loader (see `integrations/__init__.py`).
4. Update documentation and configuration as needed.

Adapters can be run as background workers, webhook endpoints, or scheduled jobs depending on the integration method required by the source system.
