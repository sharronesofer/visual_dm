"""
This test file is being removed because routers belong in the infrastructure layer
(backend/infrastructure/api/) not in the business logic layer (backend/systems/).

According to the Development Bible's clean architecture principles:
- Business logic (backend/systems/) contains models and services
- Infrastructure (backend/infrastructure/) contains repositories and routers

The correct location for combat router tests is:
backend/tests/infrastructure/api/combat/
