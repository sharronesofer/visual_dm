# POI Infrastructure Separation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the refactoring performed to enforce strict separation between business logic and technical infrastructure in the POI (Points of Interest) system.

## Problem Statement
The `/backend/systems/poi` directory contained a mix of business logic and technical infrastructure components, violating the architectural principle that `/backend/systems` should contain ONLY business logic, while `/backend/infrastructure` should contain all technical functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Directory Structure Reorganization

#### Moved from `/backend/systems/poi/` to `/backend/infrastructure/`:

- **Models** (`/models/`) → `/backend/infrastructure/poi/models/`
  - Contains SQLAlchemy entities, Pydantic schemas, request/response models
  - Technical data structures and database mappings

- **Repositories** (`/repositories/`) → `/backend/infrastructure/repositories/poi/`
  - Contains data access layer logic
  - Database query operations and CRUD functionality

- **Schemas** (`/schemas/`) → `/backend/infrastructure/schemas/poi/`
  - Contains API schema definitions (currently empty but structured)
  - Request/response validation schemas

- **Routers** (`/routers/`) → `/backend/infrastructure/api/poi/`
  - Contains API routing logic (currently empty but structured)
  - HTTP endpoint definitions and routing

- **Utils** (`/utils/`) → `/backend/infrastructure/poi/utils/`
  - Contains technical utility functions (currently empty but structured)
  - Helper functions for technical operations

#### Remained in `/backend/systems/poi/`:

- **Services** (`/services/`) - BUSINESS LOGIC ONLY
  - POI generation algorithms and world building
  - Lifecycle events and state management
  - Faction influence and political dynamics
  - Resource management and economic modeling
  - Migration patterns and population dynamics
  - Metropolitan expansion and urban growth
  - Landmark management and special locations
  - Event integration and cross-system communication
  - Unity frontend integration for visualization

- **Events** (`/events/`) - BUSINESS LOGIC ONLY
  - Business event handling (currently empty but structured)
  - Domain events and business rules

### 2. Import Path Updates

#### Updated Files:
- `backend/infrastructure/poi/models/__init__.py` - Fixed imports
- `backend/infrastructure/repositories/poi/poi_repository.py` - Updated model imports
- `backend/systems/poi/services/poi_generator.py` - Updated model imports
- `backend/systems/poi/services/services.py` - Updated model imports
- `backend/systems/poi/services/poi_state_service.py` - Updated model and repository imports
- `backend/systems/poi/services/event_integration_service.py` - Updated model imports
- `backend/systems/poi/services/landmark_service.py` - Updated model imports
- `backend/systems/poi/services/unity_frontend_integration.py` - Updated model imports
- `backend/systems/poi/services/resource_management_service.py` - Updated model imports
- `backend/systems/poi/services/metropolitan_spread_service.py` - Updated model imports
- `backend/systems/poi/services/lifecycle_events_service.py` - Updated model imports
- `backend/systems/poi/services/faction_influence_service.py` - Updated model imports
- `backend/systems/poi/services/migration_service.py` - Updated model imports
- `backend/systems/poi/__init__.py` - Updated to import from infrastructure
- All test files in `backend/tests/systems/poi/` - Updated import paths

#### Import Pattern Changes:
```python
# OLD (Technical Infrastructure in Systems)
from backend.systems.poi.models import PoiEntity, POIType, POIState
from backend.systems.poi.repositories.poi_repository import PoiRepository

# NEW (Technical Infrastructure in Infrastructure)
from backend.infrastructure.poi.models import PoiEntity, POIType, POIState
from backend.infrastructure.repositories.poi.poi_repository import PoiRepository

# UNCHANGED (Business Logic remains in Systems)
from backend.systems.poi.services import PoiService
```

### 3. Architecture Compliance

#### Before:
```
/backend/systems/poi/
├── models/          # ❌ Technical (SQLAlchemy, Pydantic)
├── repositories/    # ❌ Technical (Data Access)
├── schemas/         # ❌ Technical (API Schemas)
├── routers/         # ❌ Technical (HTTP Routing)
├── utils/           # ❌ Technical (Utilities)
├── services/        # ✅ Business Logic
└── events/          # ✅ Business Logic
```

#### After:
```
/backend/systems/poi/
├── services/        # ✅ Business Logic ONLY
└── events/          # ✅ Business Logic ONLY

/backend/infrastructure/
├── poi/
│   ├── models/      # ✅ Technical Infrastructure
│   └── utils/       # ✅ Technical Infrastructure
├── repositories/
│   └── poi/         # ✅ Technical Infrastructure
├── schemas/
│   └── poi/         # ✅ Technical Infrastructure
└── api/
    └── poi/         # ✅ Technical Infrastructure
```

## Business Logic vs Technical Infrastructure Classification

### Business Logic (Stayed in Systems):
- **POI Generation**: Procedural world building algorithms, biome preferences, settlement patterns
- **Lifecycle Events**: Growth, decline, prosperity cycles, natural disasters, cultural shifts
- **State Management**: POI state transitions, validation rules, business constraints
- **Faction Influence**: Political dynamics, territory control, diplomatic relationships
- **Resource Management**: Economic modeling, production/consumption cycles, trade relationships
- **Migration Patterns**: Population movement triggers, demographic changes, settlement dynamics
- **Metropolitan Growth**: Urban expansion patterns, suburban development, city planning
- **Landmark Management**: Cultural significance, historical importance, special abilities
- **Event Integration**: Cross-system business event coordination
- **Unity Integration**: Business data visualization and real-time updates

### Technical Infrastructure (Moved to Infrastructure):
- **Models**: SQLAlchemy entities, Pydantic schemas, database mappings
- **Repositories**: CRUD operations, database queries, data access patterns
- **Schemas**: API request/response validation, serialization formats
- **Routers**: HTTP endpoints, routing logic, API contracts
- **Utils**: Technical helper functions, data transformation utilities

## Validation

### Import Tests Passed:
```bash
# Models import successfully
python -c "from backend.infrastructure.poi.models import PoiEntity, POIType, POIState; print('POI models import successfully')"

# Repositories import successfully  
python -c "from backend.infrastructure.repositories.poi import PoiRepository; print('POI repositories import successfully')"

# Services import successfully
python -c "from backend.systems.poi.services import PoiService; print('POI services import successfully')"
```

## Known Issues

### Broken Imports (Outside Scope):
- `backend/systems/dialogue/services/poi_integration.py` imports non-existent files:
  - `backend.systems.poi.poi_manager` (file doesn't exist)
  - `backend.systems.poi.settlement_manager` (file doesn't exist)
- These would need to be addressed in a separate dialogue system refactoring

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Business logic is now cleanly separated from technical infrastructure
2. **Architectural Compliance**: Systems directory contains only business logic as intended
3. **Maintainability**: Technical changes won't affect business logic and vice versa
4. **Testability**: Business logic can be tested independently of infrastructure concerns
5. **Scalability**: Infrastructure components can be replaced without affecting business rules
6. **Code Organization**: Clear boundaries make the codebase easier to navigate and understand

## Future Considerations

1. **API Layer**: The routers directory is prepared for future API endpoint definitions
2. **Schema Evolution**: The schemas directory is ready for API contract definitions
3. **Utility Expansion**: The utils directory can accommodate technical helper functions
4. **Cross-System Integration**: The event system is positioned for better inter-system communication
5. **Testing Strategy**: Infrastructure and business logic can now be tested with appropriate strategies

This refactoring successfully enforces the architectural principle that `/backend/systems` contains ONLY business logic while `/backend/infrastructure` handles all technical concerns.
