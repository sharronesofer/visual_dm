# Security Policy and Guidelines

## 🔐 Visual DM Security Policy

This document outlines the security measures, policies, and best practices for the Visual DM application.

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by emailing [security@your-domain.com]. Please do not create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

**When reporting, please include:**
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

## 🛡️ Security Measures Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ JWT-based authentication with secure secret key management
- ✅ Bcrypt password hashing with proper salt rounds
- ✅ Environment-based test credential controls
- ✅ Token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- ✅ Session management with concurrent session limits

### API Security
- ✅ CORS configuration with environment-specific origins
- ✅ Rate limiting on all endpoints
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ SQL injection prevention through ORM usage
- ✅ File upload security with type and content validation

### Infrastructure Security
- ✅ Environment variable management for secrets
- ✅ Secure file handling with path traversal prevention
- ✅ Content-Type validation for file uploads
- ✅ Request size limiting
- ✅ Error handling without information disclosure

## 🔧 Security Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# CRITICAL: Set these in production
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-32-character-minimum-secret-key
ENVIRONMENT=production
ALLOW_TEST_CREDENTIALS=false
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-production-domain.com

# Security Settings
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=15
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS=7
MAX_CONCURRENT_SESSIONS=5
SECURE_COOKIES=true
SAMESITE_COOKIE_POLICY=strict

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=60
```

### Production Security Checklist

- [ ] Set strong JWT_SECRET_KEY (32+ characters)
- [ ] Configure CORS with specific origins
- [ ] Enable HTTPS/TLS in production
- [ ] Set ENVIRONMENT=production
- [ ] Disable test credentials (ALLOW_TEST_CREDENTIALS=false)
- [ ] Configure secure cookie settings
- [ ] Enable rate limiting
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Configure file upload restrictions
- [ ] Implement backup and recovery procedures

## 🚫 Security Guidelines

### Do NOT:
- ❌ Hardcode secrets in source code
- ❌ Use weak passwords or default credentials
- ❌ Allow unrestricted CORS origins in production
- ❌ Store sensitive data in logs
- ❌ Use HTTP in production environments
- ❌ Expose internal error details to users

### DO:
- ✅ Use environment variables for configuration
- ✅ Implement proper input validation
- ✅ Follow principle of least privilege
- ✅ Keep dependencies updated
- ✅ Monitor for security issues
- ✅ Use secure communication protocols

## 🔄 Security Update Process

1. **Dependency Updates**: Review and update dependencies monthly
2. **Security Patches**: Apply critical security patches immediately
3. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Run security scans before releases
4. **Penetration Testing**: Conduct annual security assessments
5. **Code Reviews**: Include security review in all code changes

## 📋 Compliance Requirements

### Data Protection
- User password hashing with bcrypt
- Secure session management
- PII protection and encryption
- Right to data deletion

### Access Control
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Session timeout policies
- Audit logging

## 🛠️ Security Tools and Libraries
