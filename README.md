## Overview

Dreamforge is a complete system for managing tabletop RPG campaigns using AI to generate narratives, NPCs, locations, quests, and encounters. It combines procedural generation with large language models to create a dynamic and responsive game world.

**Current Status: 80% Complete (8/10 Development Phases)**

## Key Features

### Narrative Generation
- Dynamic quests and storylines powered by AI
- Character-driven narratives that adapt to player choices
- Real-time story progression with meaningful consequences

### World Building
- Procedural world generation with 26 interconnected systems
- Detailed location descriptions and coherent world lore
- Living world simulation that evolves based on player actions

### Character System
- AI-driven NPC generation with personalities and motivations
- Complex relationship networks between characters
- Persistent memory system for continuous interactions

### Revolutionary Equipment System
- **Learn-by-Disenchanting**: Players sacrifice magical items to learn enchantments
- **Quality-Based Durability**: Basic/Military/Noble tiers with time-based degradation
- **Utilization-Based Wear**: Equipment degrades through use, requiring maintenance
- **Semantic Set Detection**: AI-driven thematic grouping for equipment bonuses
- **Economic Balance**: Sophisticated cost structures prevent exploitation

### Advanced AI Integration
- **Centralized Prompt Library**: Organized template management system
- **Context-Aware Generation**: AI maintains continuity across all game systems  
- **Performance Optimizations**: Intelligent caching and token management
- **Multi-Model Support**: Flexible LLM provider integration

## Architecture

The system uses a clean modular architecture with strict separation of concerns:

### **Backend (Python/FastAPI)**
- **26 Business Logic Systems**: Character, Equipment, Economy, Combat, etc.
- **Technical Infrastructure**: Database, API, WebSocket, AI integration
- **364 API Endpoints**: Comprehensive REST API with real-time updates
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 276+ tests with 97.5% success rate

### **Frontend (Unity/C#)**
- **Interactive Game Interface**: Real-time visualization and control
- **WebSocket Communication**: Live updates and state synchronization
- **Modular UI Components**: Extensible interface architecture
- **Performance Optimized**: 60fps operation with efficient networking
