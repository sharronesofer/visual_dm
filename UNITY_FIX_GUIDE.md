# Unity Safe Mode Fix Guide

Based on your Unity error log analysis, here's a comprehensive guide to fix the issues causing Unity to open in safe mode.

## 🔴 Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Package Dependency
- `com.mirror-networking.mirror@89.4.0` cannot be found

### 2. API Updater Failures
- Unity Analytics assemblies failing with "path is empty" errors

### 3. Assembly Definition Conflicts
- Multiple assemblies with same names:
  - `VisualDM.World` (2 copies)
  - `VisualDM.UI` (2 copies) 
  - `VisualDM.Data` (2 copies)
  - `VisualDM.Entities` (2 copies)

### 4. Massive GUID Conflicts
- Thousands of duplicate files with conflicting GUIDs
- Files exist in multiple locations (Core/, Modules/, Runtime/, etc.)

### 5. Missing Package Directories
- `Packages/com.endel.nativewebsocket/WebSocketExample`
- `Packages/com.unity.multiplayer.tools/MetricTestData/Runtime/TestData/Definitions`

## 🛠️ Automated Fix (Recommended)

Use the provided Python script to automatically fix most issues:

```bash
# Run the fix script (creates backup automatically)
python3 unity_fix_script.py /path/to/your/unity/project

# Or run without backup (not recommended)
python3 unity_fix_script.py /path/to/your/unity/project --no-backup
```

The script will:
- ✅ Create a backup of your project
- ✅ Fix package dependency issues
- ✅ Remove duplicate files intelligently 
- ✅ Resolve assembly definition conflicts
- ✅ Create missing directories
- ✅ Clean up GUID conflicts

## 🔧 Manual Fix Steps

If you prefer to fix manually or need to address specific issues:

### Step 1: Backup Your Project
```bash
# Create a complete backup before making any changes
cp -r YourUnityProject YourUnityProject_backup
```

### Step 2: Fix Package Dependencies

1. **Open Package Manager manifest**:
   ```bash
   # Edit Packages/manifest.json
   nano Packages/manifest.json
   ```

2. **Fix Mirror networking package**:
   ```json
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "com.mirror-networking.mirror": "89.3.0",
       // Remove any Unity Analytics packages causing issues
       // "com.unity.analytics": "REMOVE_THIS_LINE"
     }
   }
   ```

### Step 3: Clean Up Duplicate Files

**The major issue is having identical files in multiple locations:**

1. **Identify core vs modular structure**:
   - `Assets/Scripts/Core/` - Original location
   - `Assets/Scripts/Modules/` - Modular organization  
   - `Assets/Scripts/Runtime/` - Runtime scripts

2. **Recommended cleanup approach**:
   ```bash
   # Remove entire duplicate directory structures (choose one)
   
   # Option A: Keep Core structure, remove Modules
   rm -rf Assets/Scripts/Modules/
   
   # Option B: Keep Modules structure, remove Core  
   rm -rf Assets/Scripts/Core/
   
   # Option C: Keep Runtime structure, remove others
   rm -rf Assets/Scripts/Core/
   rm -rf Assets/Scripts/Modules/
   ```

3. **After choosing structure, clean up remaining duplicates**:
   ```bash
   # Find remaining duplicate .cs files
   find Assets/Scripts -name "*.cs" | sort | uniq -d
   
   # Remove duplicates manually, keeping the best organized copy
   ```

### Step 4: Fix Assembly Definition Conflicts

1. **Find conflicting .asmdef files**:
   ```bash
   find Assets -name "*.asmdef" -exec grep -l "VisualDM.World\|VisualDM.UI\|VisualDM.Data\|VisualDM.Entities" {} \;
   ```

2. **Rename or remove duplicates**:
   - Keep the main assembly definition
   - Rename duplicates with unique names:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "VisualDM.World.Secondary",
       // other properties...
     }
     ```

### Step 5: Create Missing Directories

```bash
# Create missing package directories
mkdir -p Packages/com.endel.nativewebsocket/WebSocketExample
mkdir -p Packages/com.unity.multiplayer.tools/MetricTestData/Runtime/TestData/Definitions

# Add .gitkeep files to preserve empty directories
touch Packages/com.endel.nativewebsocket/WebSocketExample/.gitkeep
touch Packages/com.unity.multiplayer.tools/MetricTestData/Runtime/TestData/Definitions/.gitkeep
```

### Step 6: Clear Unity Cache (Important!)

```bash
# Close Unity completely first, then:

# Clear Unity cache
rm -rf Library/
rm -rf Temp/
rm -rf obj/

# Clear package cache
rm -rf Packages/packages-lock.json
```

## 🚀 After Running Fixes

### 1. Open Unity
- Unity should now open normally (not in safe mode)
- Let Unity reimport all assets (this may take several minutes)

### 2. Check Package Manager
- Open `Window > Package Manager`
- Verify all packages are properly installed
- Update any packages with issues

### 3. Fix Remaining Compilation Errors
- Check the Console for any remaining errors
- Most GUID conflicts should be resolved automatically
- Fix any remaining import/reference issues

### 4. Test Project Functionality
- Verify all systems work as expected
- Test networking features (Mirror)
- Check that all scripts compile successfully

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Always backup before running fixes** - Some operations are irreversible
2. **Choose one file structure** - Don't try to maintain both Core/ and Modules/ structures
3. **Let Unity reimport completely** - Don't interrupt the reimport process
4. **Fix in order** - Follow the steps sequentially for best results

## 🔍 Common Issues After Fix

### If Unity still opens in safe mode:
1. Check console for new error messages
2. Verify all packages are correctly installed
3. Ensure no compilation errors remain
4. Try creating a new scene to test

### If scripts are missing references:
1. Use Unity's missing script recovery tools
2. Reassign scripts to GameObjects
3. Check namespace imports in affected scripts

### If performance is poor after fix:
1. Rebuild asset database: `Assets > Reimport All`
2. Clear and rebuild lighting data
3. Restart Unity completely

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues with the fixes:
1. Check the backup you created
2. Review Unity console messages  
3. Try a smaller subset of fixes first
4. Consider using Unity's built-in recovery tools

Remember: The automated script handles most common cases safely, but manual fixes give you more control over the process.
