   - Select "PlayMode" tab
   - Find "VDM.Tests.Integration" assembly
   - Click "Run All" or select specific tests

3. **Benchmark Tests:**
   - Look for tests starting with "Benchmark_"
   - These validate specific success criteria
   - Check console for detailed performance metrics

### Manual Testing (Optional)

1. **Load Demo Scene:**
   - Open `VDM/Assets/Scenes/Tests/PerformanceIntegrationDemo.unity`

2. **Run Demo Controller:**
   - Enter Play mode
   - Observe real-time performance metrics
   - Use buttons to trigger stress tests
   - Monitor alert system responses

## üìä Test Results Interpretation

### Success Indicators

‚úÖ **Green**: All tests pass, performance meets criteria
‚ö†Ô∏è **Yellow**: Tests pass with warnings, performance acceptable but not optimal
‚ùå **Red**: Tests fail, performance does not meet criteria

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **FPS Performance:**
   - Target: Maintain 60fps average
   - Tolerance: < 10% of measurements below 60fps
   - Test Duration: 5 seconds under simulated load

2. **Memory Usage:**
   - Target: Stay under 2GB (2048MB)
   - Peak Tolerance: Up to 2.4GB (20% overhead)
   - Test: Memory stress with 1000 objects + cleanup

3. **API Response Times:**
   - Target: Average < 200ms
   - Tolerance: < 20% of requests may exceed 200ms
   - Test: 10 concurrent API requests

4. **Monitoring Effectiveness:**
   - All 33 VDM systems should be trackable
   - Cache hit rates > 10% when applicable
   - Alert system responds to threshold breaches
   - Cross-component integration functional

## üîß Performance Components Tested

### 1. PerformanceMonitor
- **Functionality:** Real-time FPS, memory, and system activity tracking
- **Integration:** Monitors all other components
- **Validation:** Metrics accuracy, alert triggering, system tracking

### 2. CacheManager
- **Functionality:** Intelligent caching with LRU and compression
- **Integration:** Used by HTTP client, monitored by PerformanceMonitor
- **Validation:** Hit rates, memory usage, cache categories

### 3. OptimizedHttpClient
- **Functionality:** Connection pooling, request batching, caching
- **Integration:** Uses CacheManager, monitored by PerformanceMonitor
- **Validation:** Response times, connection efficiency, cache integration

### 4. OptimizedWebSocketClient
- **Functionality:** Message batching, priority queuing, auto-reconnection
- **Integration:** Monitored by PerformanceMonitor
- **Validation:** Message throughput, queue management, connection stability

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tests Fail to Compile:**
   - Ensure VDM.Runtime assembly exists
   - Check that all performance components are implemented
   - Verify Unity Test Framework is installed

2. **Performance Benchmarks Fail:**
   - Check if running in Unity Editor vs Build
   - Editor performance may be lower due to debugging overhead
   - Run tests in Release build for accurate performance metrics

3. **Network Tests Always Fail:**
   - HTTP/WebSocket tests may fail if no backend is running
   - This is expected and tests handle graceful failure
   - Focus on local performance metrics and component integration

4. **Memory Tests Inconsistent:**
   - Unity's garbage collector may affect memory measurements
   - Multiple test runs may show variation
   - Look for trends rather than exact values

### Performance Optimization Tips

1. **If FPS tests fail:**
   - Check for expensive operations in Update loops
   - Verify object pooling is working correctly
   - Monitor Unity Profiler during tests

2. **If memory tests fail:**
   - Look for memory leaks in component cleanup
   - Ensure cache eviction is working properly
   - Check for large object retention

3. **If API tests fail:**
   - Verify network connection
   - Check HTTP client configuration
   - Monitor actual network latency

## üìà Expected Performance Characteristics

### Baseline Performance (Unity Editor)
- **FPS:** 60-120fps (depends on hardware)
- **Memory:** 200-500MB baseline
- **API:** Local requests < 50ms, network varies

### Stress Test Performance
- **FPS:** Should maintain > 60fps during moderate stress
- **Memory:** Peak usage < 2GB, cleanup to < 1.5GB
- **API:** Batch processing should improve efficiency

### Production Performance (Built Application)
- **FPS:** Higher than editor (no debugging overhead)
- **Memory:** Lower baseline usage
- **API:** Consistent with network conditions

## üîÑ Continuous Integration

These tests are designed for CI/CD integration:

1. **Automated Execution:** All tests can run headless
2. **Performance Regression Detection:** Benchmark thresholds catch performance degradation
3. **Cross-Platform Validation:** Tests work on all Unity-supported platforms
4. **Metric Collection:** Test results include detailed performance data

**Note:** These integration tests are the first step in comprehensive testing. They validate that the performance optimization system works correctly and meets basic criteria. For production deployment, additional load testing, device-specific testing, and user acceptance testing should be performed.
