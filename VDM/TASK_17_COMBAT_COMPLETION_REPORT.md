3. **Attacking**: Performing attack action
4. **Dead**: Player defeated, respawn timer active

### Visual Feedback
- Health bars with color coding (Green > Yellow > Red)
- Damage flash effects on hit
- Combat status indicators
- Target highlighting
- Floating damage numbers
- Death/respawn visual changes

### Enemy AI Behavior

## 🔧 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Integration Points

#### PlayerMovement Integration (Task 13)
```csharp
// In BasicCombatSystem.cs
private PlayerMovement playerMovement;
playerMovement = GetComponent<PlayerMovement>();
```

#### IInteractable Interface (Task 14)
```csharp
// Interface defined in PlayerMovement.cs
public interface IInteractable
{
    void OnPlayerEnter(PlayerMovement player);
    void OnPlayerExit(PlayerMovement player);
    void Interact(PlayerMovement player);
}
```

#### ICombatTarget Interface
```csharp
public interface ICombatTarget
{
    void TakeDamage(int damage, BasicCombatSystem attacker);
    Vector3 GetPosition();
    bool IsAlive();
    string GetName();
}
```

### Network Synchronization Placeholder
```csharp
private struct CombatNetworkData
{
    public int health;
    public CombatState state;
    public float lastAttackTime;
}
```

### Event System
```csharp
// Combat Events
public System.Action<int, int> OnHealthChanged;
public System.Action<ICombatTarget> OnTargetSelected;
public System.Action<ICombatTarget, int> OnAttackExecuted;
public System.Action OnCombatStarted;
public System.Action OnCombatEnded;
public System.Action OnPlayerDeath;
```
