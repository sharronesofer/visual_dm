# Visual DM Time System Refactoring

This document describes the changes made to the Visual DM time system to bring it into alignment with the Development Bible requirements.

## Overview of Changes

The time system has been refactored to better align with the architectural guidelines in the Development Bible. Key changes include:

1. **Proper Integration with Canonical EventDispatcher**
   - Time-related events now use the canonical EventDispatcher for event emission
   - New TimeEvent classes extend EventBase for proper type safety and serialization

2. **Standardized TimeUnit and EventType Enums**
   - Created proper TimeUnit enum: Tick, Second, Minute, Hour, Day, Month, Year, Season
   - Created proper EventType enum: OneTime, RecurringDaily, RecurringWeekly, RecurringMonthly, RecurringYearly, SeasonChange, SpecialDate
   - Added comprehensive XML documentation for all enum values

3. **Decoupled Weather System**
   - Extracted weather functionality from TimeSystemFacade into a separate WeatherSystem class
   - Implemented event-based communication between time and weather systems
   - Created proper weather events that extend EventBase

4. **Middleware Support for Event Scheduler**
   - Added IEventSchedulerMiddleware interface
   - Implemented middleware manager for registering and executing middleware
   - Created example middleware implementations (LoggingMiddleware, EventFilterMiddleware)

5. **Priority Queue for Event Scheduling**
   - Implemented a PriorityEventQueue for efficient event scheduling
   - Events are now ordered by time and priority
   - Improved processing of events through the middleware chain

6. **Proper Event Class Hierarchy**
   - Created TimeEventBase as a base class for all time-related events
   - Implemented specific event classes (TimeChangedEvent, TimeScaleChangedEvent, etc.)
   - Added proper serialization support for all events

## New Files Added

- `TimeUnits.cs`: Contains canonical TimeUnit and EventType enums
- `TimeEvents.cs`: Contains TimeEventBase and specific event classes
- `Season.cs`: Contains Season enum and related utilities
- `IEventSchedulerMiddleware.cs`: Interface for event scheduler middleware
- `EventSchedulerMiddlewareManager.cs`: Manages middleware registration and execution
- `PriorityEventQueue.cs`: Priority queue implementation for scheduled events
- `Middleware/LoggingMiddleware.cs`: Example middleware for logging events
- `Middleware/EventFilterMiddleware.cs`: Example middleware for filtering events
- `Weather/WeatherSystem.cs`: New decoupled weather system

## Modified Files

- `TimeSystemFacade.cs`: Updated to use canonical event system, middleware, and priority queue
- `CalendarSystem.cs`: Updated to support new TimeUnit enum and add required properties

## Usage Examples

### Scheduling Events with Middleware

```csharp
// Get the TimeSystemFacade instance
var timeSystem = GetComponent<TimeSystemFacade>();

// Add middleware
timeSystem.AddMiddleware(new LoggingMiddleware("CustomLogger"));

// Create an event filter middleware
var filter = new EventFilterMiddleware();
filter.BlockEventType(EventType.RecurringDaily);
timeSystem.AddMiddleware(filter);

// Schedule an event
timeSystem.ScheduleEvent(
    EventType.OneTime,
    DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(5),
    null,
    () => Debug.Log("Event triggered!"),
    10,
    "ImportantEvent"
);
```

### Using the Decoupled Weather System

```csharp
// Get the WeatherSystem instance
var weatherSystem = GetComponent<WeatherSystem>();

// Subscribe to weather change events
EventDispatcher.Instance.Subscribe<WeatherChangedEvent>(evt => {
    Debug.Log($"Weather changed from {evt.PreviousWeather} to {evt.NewWeather}");
});

// Set weather directly
weatherSystem.SetWeather(WeatherType.Thunderstorm);

// Configure weather probabilities
weatherSystem.SetWeatherProbability(WeatherType.Blizzard, 5.0f);
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Event Batching**: Add support for batching multiple events that occur simultaneously
2. **Advanced Filtering**: Enhance middleware to support more complex filtering patterns
3. **Performance Optimizations**: Further optimize event processing for large numbers of events
4. **Additional Weather Features**: Add more detailed weather progression and effects
5. **Serialization Support**: Improve serialization of events for save/load functionality

## Conclusion

These changes bring the time system into better alignment with the Development Bible's architecture guidelines, particularly regarding event-driven design, loose coupling, and standardized interfaces. The system is now more maintainable, extensible, and better integrated with the rest of the game architecture.
