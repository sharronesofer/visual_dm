# Frontend Systems Inventory (Unity)

**Updated:** 2025-01-27
**Total Systems:** 35 (mirroring backend)
**Architecture:** VDM/Assets/Scripts/

## Frontend Architecture Overview

The Unity frontend follows a clean architectural pattern that mirrors the backend systems exactly, ensuring consistency and maintainability across the full-stack application.

## Critical Infrastructure Status

### Core Infrastructure
- **Core/**: ❌ Empty - Foundation classes needed
- **Infrastructure/**: 🟡 Partial - Services exist but broken compilation
- **DTOs/**: ❌ Missing - Critical blocker for all systems
- **UI/**: ❌ Empty - No UI framework implemented
- **Services/**: ❌ Empty - Global services missing
- **Integration/**: ❌ Empty - Unity integrations missing
- **Runtime/**: ❌ Empty - Runtime logic missing

### Compilation Status
- **Status**: 🔴 Critical - 200+ compilation errors
- **Blocker**: Missing DTOs and namespace dependencies
- **Dependencies**: NativeWebSocket, performance monitors, base classes

## Implementation Priority

### Critical Priority (Blocking All Development)
1. **Fix Compilation Errors** - 200+ errors preventing builds
2. **Implement DTO Layer** - Required for all API communication  
3. **Create UI Framework** - Foundation for all user interfaces

### High Priority
1. **Region System Completion** - Backend ready, frontend partial
2. **Character System** - Core gameplay functionality
3. **Combat System** - Essential game mechanics

### Medium Priority
1. **Quest System** - Narrative progression
2. **Inventory System** - Item management
3. **Faction System** - Political gameplay

### Low Priority
1. **Directory Structure Cleanup** - Consolidate duplicate directories
2. **Analytics System** - Metrics and telemetry
3. **Modding Support** - Community features

## Detailed System Analysis

### Region System (Most Advanced)

**Status:** 🟡 Partial Implementation

**Implemented:**
- ✅ Services layer complete (RegionService.cs, RegionWebSocketHandler.cs)
- ✅ Full API endpoint coverage
- ✅ WebSocket real-time updates
- ✅ Error handling and logging

**Missing:**
- ❌ Models/DTOs for data structures
- ❌ UI components for region display
- ❌ Integration with Unity map system
- ❌ Interactive region visualization

**Next Steps:**
- Implement RegionDTO and related models
- Create RegionMapView UI component
- Build interactive hex-grid map system
- Add biome and resource visualization

### Combat System

**Status:** 🟡 Minimal Structure

**Implemented:**
- ✅ Directory structure with README
- ✅ Four-layer pattern established

**Missing:**
- ❌ All implementation layers empty
- ❌ Combat mechanics and calculations
- ❌ Combat UI and action interface
- ❌ Integration with character system

## Dependencies and Blockers

### External Dependencies
- **NativeWebSocket**: Required for WebSocket functionality
- **Unity UI Toolkit**: Modern UI framework
- **Unity Mathematics**: Performance optimizations
- **Unity Addressables**: Asset management

### Internal Blockers
1. **DTO Layer Missing**: Prevents all API communication
2. **Infrastructure Broken**: Compilation errors block development
3. **UI Framework Absent**: No foundation for user interfaces
4. **Performance Classes Missing**: Services can't instantiate

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. Fix all compilation errors and restore building capability
2. Implement comprehensive DTO layer mirroring backend models
3. Create basic UI framework with reusable components

### Short Term (Month 1)
1. Complete region system implementation with full visualization
2. Implement character system frontend with progression UI
3. Create combat system with action interface

### Long Term (Quarter 1)
1. Complete all 35 system implementations
2. Implement comprehensive testing framework
3. Optimize performance and add advanced features

## Quality Metrics

### Current State
- **Systems Implemented**: 0/35 (0%)
