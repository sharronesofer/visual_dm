"""
Deterministic Random Number Generation for the WorldGen System

This module provides a robust implementation of a deterministic random number generator
(DeterministicRNG) for use in procedural world generation, testing, and debugging within
the WorldGen system.

Key features:
- Deterministic behavior ensures reproducible procedural generation
- Support for various probability distributions (uniform, normal, etc.)
- Hierarchical seed management for organized subsystem randomness
- Thread-safe independent instances for parallel generation
- Comprehensive testing support for all distributions

The deterministic nature of the random number generator is essential for:
1. Debugging procedural generation systems
2. Reproducing and fixing specific issues in generated content
3. Supporting seed-based world generation with consistent results
4. Enabling unit testing of generation components

For proper usage across the WorldGen system, each component should use its own
dedicated RNG instance with an appropriate seed configuration.

    Configuration class for managing random number generator seeds in the WorldGen system.
    
    This class provides a structured approach to organizing seeds throughout a complex
    procedural generation pipeline, ensuring reproducibility and effective debugging.
    
    Key features:
    - Supports named seeds for easy identification in logs and debugging
    - Enables hierarchical seed structure for organized subsystem randomness
    - Maintains parent-child relationships between generation components
    
    The hierarchy system allows different aspects of world generation to have their
    own distinct randomness while maintaining a coherent overall structure:
    
    - World seed (master)

      └── Structures seed (child)
          ├── Buildings seed (grandchild)
          └── Dungeons seed (grandchild)

    doesn't affect other aspects (e.g., terrain).

class DeterministicRNG:
    """
    Implementation of a deterministic random number generator for the WorldGen system.
    
    This class provides methods to generate various random distributions in a deterministic way,
    ensuring that the same sequence of random numbers is produced when initialized with the
    same seed. This is crucial for reproducible procedural generation, testing, and debugging.
    
    The generator uses the xorshift algorithm, which is fast and produces high-quality
    random numbers with good statistical properties. The implementation is carefully designed
    to ensure consistent results across different platforms and Python versions.
    
    Key features:
    - Deterministic behavior: Same seed produces the same sequence
    - Multiple distribution types: uniform, normal, integer ranges, boolean, choice selection
    - Reset capability: Return to the initial state to reproduce sequences
    - Thread-safe: Each instance maintains its own state
    
    Usage:
        >>> seed_config = ISeedConfig(12345, "terrain_gen")
        >>> rng = DeterministicRNG(seed_config)
        >>> random_value = rng.random()  # Float between 0 and 1
        >>> terrain_height = rng.uniform(0.0, 100.0)  # Float in specific range
        >>> tree_count = rng.randint(10, 20)  # Integer in specific range
        >>> has_water = rng.boolean(0.3)  # Boolean with 30% probability of True
        >>> tree_type = rng.choice(["oak", "pine", "birch", "maple"])  # Random selection
    
    Advanced usage (reproducibility):
        >>> rng = DeterministicRNG(ISeedConfig(12345))
        >>> values1 = [rng.random() for _ in range(5)]
        >>> rng.reset()  # Reset to initial state
        >>> values2 = [rng.random() for _ in range(5)]
        >>> assert values1 == values2  # Same sequence guaranteed
    
    Seed Management:
        Proper seed management is crucial for deterministic procedural generation. Consider these 
        guidelines for effective seed usage:
        
        1. Hierarchical seeds: Create a hierarchy of seeds for different generation aspects.
           - Use a master seed for the entire world
           - Derive subsystem seeds for terrain, vegetation, structures, etc.
           - This allows regenerating specific aspects without affecting others
        
        2. Named seeds: Always use descriptive names for your seed configurations to aid debugging.
        
        3. Seed isolation: Each system component should have its own RNG instance to prevent
           one system's random number usage from affecting others.
        
        4. Testing: Always test with fixed seeds during development to ensure reproducibility.
        
        5. Distribution selection: Choose the appropriate distribution method based on your needs:
           - uniform(): For continuous values in a range (terrain heights, temperatures)
           - randint(): For discrete values in a range (item counts, entity IDs)
           - normal(): For values that cluster around a mean (natural distributions)
           - boolean(): For binary decisions with controlled probability
           - choice(): For selection from discrete options with optional weighting
        
    Implementation notes:
        The xorshift algorithm was chosen for its simplicity, speed, and good statistical properties.
        While not cryptographically secure, it's excellent for game and simulation purposes.
        
        For statistical distributions like normal/Gaussian, the implementation uses established
        transformations (Box-Muller) to convert the uniform distribution to the desired shape.

            This method is particularly useful for generating binary features in procedural

            random(), which can have bias issues in some implementations.

            - Biome transitions with fuzzy boundaries
            - Random events with controlled probability
            - Procedural decision points in generation algorithms

        Randomly select an item from a sequence, with optional weighting.
        
        This method allows for both uniform and weighted random selection from a sequence.

        Args:

                the probability of selecting the corresponding item. Defaults to None,
                which results in uniform selection.

        Notes:
            This method is particularly useful for procedural generation scenarios where
            you need to select from discrete options, such as:
            
            - Biome or terrain type selection
            - Entity/NPC type placement
            - Item generation with rarity tiers
            - Feature selection based on weighted importance
            
            The weighted selection uses a cumulative distribution approach, which ensures
            accurate probability distribution according to the weights while maintaining
            deterministic behavior.
            
            For large arrays, the weighted selection algorithm has O(n) complexity where n 
            is the number of items. For performance-critical code with many options, consider
            pre-computing the cumulative distributions and using binary search.

            2. Alternative generation: Generate multiple variations of content with the same 
               randomness, allowing for comparison of different algorithms with identical inputs.
            
            3. Preview generation: Generate a preview of content using the same seed that will 
               be used for the final version, ensuring the preview accurately represents the result.
            
            4. Testing: Create deterministic test cases by using known seeds and resetting
