# TypeScript to C#/Python Migration Project
## Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
This project involves migrating the Visual DM codebase from its current TypeScript implementation to a dual-language architecture featuring Python (backend) and C# (Unity frontend). The migration will preserve all existing functionality while leveraging the strengths of each target language and improving the system's maintainability, performance, and extensibility.

## Core Objectives

### 1. Complete Language Migration
- Migrate all TypeScript code to equivalent Python (backend) and C# (Unity) implementations
- Maintain functional equivalence while embracing language-specific best practices
- Implement comprehensive test coverage for migrated components
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing data and APIs

### 2. Architecture Optimization
- Refactor code to leverage language-specific strengths (C# for Unity frontend, Python for backend)
- Implement appropriate design patterns for each language ecosystem
- Optimize performance-critical components
- Enhance error handling and logging capabilities

### 3. Enhanced Testing Strategy
- Implement unit tests for all migrated components
- Create integration tests to verify cross-component functionality
- Develop end-to-end tests to validate system behavior
- Ensure test coverage meets or exceeds original codebase

### 4. Documentation and Knowledge Transfer
- Document architecture decisions and migration patterns
- Create comprehensive API documentation
- Establish coding standards for Python and C# components
- Provide examples of common patterns and idioms

## Technical Requirements

### Python Backend Requirements
- Use Python 3.9+ with type annotations
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Leverage FastAPI for API endpoints
- Implement asynchronous patterns where appropriate
- Use Pydantic for data validation and serialization
- Support unit testing with pytest

### C# Unity Frontend Requirements
- Use C# 9.0+ features where appropriate
- Follow Unity C# coding conventions
- Implement appropriate Unity design patterns (e.g., ScriptableObjects, Singletons)
- Use Unity's new Input System for input handling
- Leverage UniTask for asynchronous operations
- Support unit testing with NUnit and Unity Test Framework

### Migration Patterns

#### Core Utility Migration
- Logger implementation in both Python and C#
- EventBus/EventEmitter system with equivalent functionality
- ID generation with improved uniqueness guarantees
- Feature flag system with consistent API
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

#### Dialogue Generation Subsystem
- GPTClient for API communication
- DialogueGenerationService for high-level operations
- Response caching and context management
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

#### Pathfinding and Collision Systems
- Implement A* pathfinding algorithm
- Quadtree spatial partitioning for collision detection
- Grid-based movement and placement
- Group movement and formation pathfinding

#### UI Components
- Convert React-based UI to Unity UI components
- Implement equivalent state management patterns
- Ensure consistent theming and styling
- Maintain accessibility features

## Migration Process

### Phase 1: Core Utilities and Foundational Systems
- Migrate logging, event systems, and core utilities
- Implement common data structures and type definitions
- Establish testing patterns and conventions
- Create baseline benchmarks for performance comparison

### Phase 2: Backend Business Logic
- Migrate service layers and data processing
- Implement domain-specific logic in Python
- Create API endpoints and serialization
- Develop backend integration tests

### Phase 3: Frontend Visualization and Interaction
- Migrate UI components to Unity
- Implement interactive features and animations
- Create visualization systems for world elements
- Develop frontend unit tests

### Phase 4: Integration and Performance Optimization
- Connect frontend and backend components
- Optimize performance-critical pathways
- Implement caching and resource pooling
- Ensure cross-system compatibility

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all migrated components
- Integration tests for critical workflows
- Performance tests comparing to original implementation
- Test coverage minimum of 80% for new code

## Documentation Requirements
- Inline code documentation (docstrings, XML comments)
- Architecture decision records
- API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI for Python, XML docs for C#)
- Migration pattern examples
