# Dreamforge Character System Test Coverage Improvements PRD

## Overview

The backend/systems/character directory in the Dreamforge application currently has insufficient test coverage (currently at 17%). This PRD outlines the work needed to improve test coverage to at least 90% by adding comprehensive tests for all components in the character system.

## Objectives

1. Identify the current test coverage gaps in the character system
2. Create comprehensive test cases for all major classes and methods in the character system
3. Fix any existing broken tests in the character system
4. Ensure all tests follow consistent patterns and best practices
5. Document testing patterns for future development of the character system

## Requirements

### Test Coverage Analysis

1. Run test coverage analysis on the character system:
   - Identify untested classes and methods
   - Identify partially tested components
   - Prioritize high-impact components with low coverage

2. Review existing tests:
   - Identify broken or ineffective tests
   - Assess the quality of existing tests
   - Document patterns to replicate and anti-patterns to avoid

### MoodService Test Improvements

1. Create comprehensive tests for the MoodService:
   - Test initialization of moods
   - Test creating different types of moods
   - Test adding mood modifiers
   - Test the activation and deactivation of moods
   - Test mood state management and transitions

### CharacterService Test Improvements

1. Create comprehensive tests for the CharacterService:
   - Test character creation with various parameters
   - Test character retrieval methods
   - Test character state management
   - Test character relationship management
   - Test integration with other services (MoodService, GoalService, etc.)

### Character Model Test Improvements

1. Create comprehensive tests for the Character model:
   - Test Character instantiation with different parameters
   - Test all properties and methods of the Character class
   - Test serialization and deserialization
   - Test character state management methods

### Relationship Model Test Improvements

1. Create comprehensive tests for the Relationship model:
   - Test Relationship instantiation with different parameters
   - Test relationship type validation
   - Test relationship strength calculations
   - Test serialization and deserialization

### General Test Improvements

1. Implement test fixtures and factories:
   - Create reusable character fixtures
   - Create mood and relationship factories
   - Create mock dependencies for isolated testing

2. Implement test patterns for common scenarios:
   - Test database error handling
   - Test edge cases and error conditions
   - Test service integration points

## Success Criteria

1. Test coverage for the character system reaches at least 90%
2. All tests pass consistently
3. Tests cover all critical functionality of the character system
4. Tests follow consistent patterns and best practices
5. Documentation is updated with proper testing patterns
