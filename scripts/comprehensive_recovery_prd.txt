# Visual DM Recovery & Integration PRD

## Project Overview
Visual DM is a Unity-based modding framework for managing and visualizing game worlds with a two-tier modding system. The project currently has multiple compilation errors, opens in safe mode, and lacks proper integration between the Unity client and FastAPI backend. This PRD outlines the comprehensive recovery plan to achieve full functionality and readiness for basic playtesting.

## Current State Assessment
- Unity project opens in safe mode with compilation errors
- Multiple package dependency issues (Mirror Networking, DataAnnotations)
- Duplicate class definitions causing namespace conflicts
- Backend exists but lacks proper integration with Unity client
- No sprite system or basic gameplay mechanics implemented
- Missing critical networking and real-time communication setup

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Unity 2021.3 LTS
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Networking**: Mirror Networking 96.6.4
- **WebSocket**: NativeWebSocket for real-time communication
- **Database**: JSON-based data storage (modding system)
- **Testing**: Unity Test Runner, pytest

## Recovery & Development Goals

- Design placeholder art assets for testing

### Phase 6: Basic Gameplay Implementation
**Goal**: Achieve minimum viable gameplay for playtesting
- Implement basic character movement and controls
- Create simple interaction system
- Set up basic inventory management
- Implement simple combat mechanics placeholder
- Create basic UI for core game functions
- Design basic game loop for testing

### Phase 7: Playtesting Preparation
**Goal**: Prepare project for comprehensive playtesting
- Implement save/load system
- Create automated testing suite
- Set up performance monitoring
- Implement error reporting system
- Create debugging tools and console commands
- Prepare test scenarios and documentation
