# Performance Monitoring Dashboard Specification

## Purpose
To provide real-time and historical visibility into the performance of the Interaction System during play-testing and production, enabling rapid detection of issues and validation of performance targets.

---

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Active interactions (total, by type)
- Response times (average, 95th percentile, max)
- Memory usage (total, by interaction type)
- CPU load (overall, by system component)
- Bandwidth usage (multiplayer)
- Error rates (by type)
- Frame rate impact

---

## Dashboard Features
- Real-time visualizations (charts, gauges, tables)
- Historical trend analysis (selectable time windows)
- Color-coded alert indicators (green/yellow/red)
- Filtering by interaction type, platform, or user
- Session recording and playback for post-analysis
- Exportable reports (CSV, PDF)

---

## Alerting & Thresholds
- Warning at 70% of target, critical at 90%
- Custom thresholds for priority interactions
- Email/Slack/webhook integration for critical alerts
- Alert log with timestamps and affected KPIs

---

## Integration Points
- Data collection hooks in Interaction System (API, middleware, or event bus)
- Aggregation service for metrics (e.g., Prometheus, custom Node.js service)
- UI frontend (web-based, React or similar)
- Optional integration with Building/POI systems for coordinated resource monitoring

---

## Extensibility & Accessibility
- Modular widget/component system for new KPIs
- Support for colorblind modes and screen readers
- Configurable dashboard layouts per user/team
- API for external tools to query metrics

---

## Example Layout
- Top: Summary KPIs (active, latency, memory, CPU, bandwidth, errors)
- Middle: Real-time charts (latency, memory, CPU, bandwidth)
- Bottom: Alert log, session controls, export options

---

## Implementation Notes
- Use efficient, low-overhead data collection to avoid impacting system performance
- Store historical data for at least 30 days
- Secure access with authentication/authorization
- Document all metrics and dashboard features for future maintainers
