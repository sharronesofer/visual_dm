# Visual DM Memory System Refactoring - Overview

## Project Goal
Refactor the Visual DM Memory System to align with the Development Bible specifications, focusing on entity-local memories, proper repository pattern, JSON storage, and event-based communication.

## Key Achievements

### ✅ Core Memory Support
- Added `is_core` property to the Memory model class
- Updated memory creation methods to support setting this property
- Modified memory decay system to respect core memories that don't decay

### ✅ Entity-Local Memory Model
- Removed non-entity memory functions (faction, region, world, POI)
- Updated dependent code to use entity-based memories
- Ensured memory ownership is strictly tied to entities

### ✅ JSON Storage Implementation
- Created StorageManager abstract base class for storage operations
- Implemented JSONStorageManager with versioning support
- Updated memory persistence to use JSON storage
- Added proper serialization/deserialization of memory objects

### ✅ Simplified Cognitive Frames
- Reduced the number of frames from 20+ to 4 core frames
- Simplified metadata structure
- Removed complex relationships between frames
- Updated utility functions to work with the simplified system

## Next Steps

### 1. Event System Standardization
- Review and standardize memory events
- Ensure all memory operations emit appropriate events
- Implement event-based information sharing

### 2. Clean Repository Pattern
- Implement a proper repository pattern for memory access
- Update memory_manager.py to use the repository
- Ensure all memory access goes through the repository

### 3. Testing & Documentation
- Create comprehensive tests for the refactored system
- Update API documentation
- Document new functionality and architecture

## Conclusion
The refactoring is progressing well, with 5 of the 10 planned tasks completed. The most significant architectural changes (core memory support, entity-local model, JSON storage, simplified cognitive frames) have been implemented. The remaining work focuses on standardizing the event system, implementing a clean repository pattern, and ensuring comprehensive testing and documentation.
