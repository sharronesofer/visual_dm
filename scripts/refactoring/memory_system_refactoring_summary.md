# Memory System Refactoring - Progress Summary

## Completed Tasks

### Task 102: Update Memory Model Class with Core Memory Support ✅
- Added `is_core` property to the Memory model class
- Updated constructor and factory methods to support this property
- Ensured proper handling in serialization/deserialization
- Removed emotional_valence property not specified in the Development Bible

### Task 103: Remove Non-Entity Memory Functions ✅
- Removed functions handling faction, region, world, and POI memories
- Updated dependent code to use entity-based memories
- Removed references from export in __init__.py
- Updated process_gpt_memory_entry to use entity-local approach

### Task 104: Implement Memory Decay System Respecting Core Memories ✅
- Updated run_memory_decay to check for is_core flag
- Added logic to skip decay for core memories
- Updated documentation to reflect new behavior
- Improved code readability with clear comments

### Task 107: Simplify Cognitive Frames System ✅
- Reduced cognitive frames from 20+ to 4 core frames
- Simplified metadata structure, removing opposites and related frames
- Updated utility functions to work with simplified frames
- Maintained backward compatibility of API

### Task 105: Implement JSON Storage for Memory System ✅
- Created StorageManager abstract base class
- Implemented JSONStorageManager with versioning support
- Integrated JSON storage with the memory manager
- Ensured proper serialization/deserialization of memory objects
- Added support for versioning memories

## In Progress Tasks
None currently. Ready to start on the next task.

## Next Tasks

### Task 106: Standardize Memory Events
- Review current event emissions in memory_manager.py
- Ensure all memory operations emit appropriate events
- Standardize event data structure

### Task 108: Create Clean Repository Pattern
- Implement a proper repository pattern for memory access
- Update memory_manager.py to use the repository
- Ensure all memory access goes through the repository

### Task 109: Implement Event-Based Information Sharing
- Replace direct memory sharing with event-based mechanism
- Ensure memory information is only shared through events
- Update relevant utility functions

## Remaining Tasks

### Task 110: Write Comprehensive Tests
- Create tests for core memory functionality
- Test memory decay with core memories
- Test the simplified cognitive frames system
- Test JSON storage and versioning

### Task 111: Update Documentation
- Update API documentation
- Document the new JSON storage system
- Document the core memory functionality
- Document the simplified cognitive frames system

### Task 112: Implement Migration Tools
- Create tools to migrate from Firebase to JSON storage
- Handle conversion of existing memory formats
- Ensure data integrity during migration

## Implementation Notes

The refactoring process has revealed that the current memory system had several features not specified in the Development Bible, leading to complexity and potential maintenance issues. Our approach has been to systematically identify and remove these unspecified features while maintaining core functionality.

The Development Bible specifies:
- Entity-local memories (never directly shared)
- Repository pattern for memory storage
- JSON storage with versioning
- Core memories that don't decay
- Event-based communication

Our implementation now better aligns with these specifications. The next steps will focus on the storage layer and repository pattern implementation to complete the alignment.
