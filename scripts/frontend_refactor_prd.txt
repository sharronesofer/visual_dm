# Frontend-Backend Architecture Alignment PRD

## Project Overview

### Problem Statement
The Unity frontend currently has an inconsistent directory structure that doesn't mirror the backend systems architecture. This creates:
- Developer confusion when navigating between frontend and backend code
- Unclear separation of concerns between business logic (backend) and presentation logic (frontend)
- Difficulty in maintaining and extending systems
- Inconsistent API consumption patterns
- Missing UI components for core game functionality

### Solution Vision
Refactor the Unity frontend structure to:
1. Mirror the backend systems directory structure exactly
2. Implement clear separation where backend is source of truth for all business logic
3. Create frontend components that purely handle presentation, input, and API consumption
4. Implement missing UI components for core game functionality
5. Establish consistent patterns for frontend-backend integration

## Core Requirements

### 1. Structure Analysis & Planning (Priority: Critical)
- Analyze development_bible.md to understand all required systems
- Map current backend/systems/ directory structure to understand target architecture
- Audit current Unity Assets/Scripts/Runtime/ structure to identify what needs migration
- Create detailed migration plan with dependency mapping
- Identify obvious UI components needed (menus, HUD, maps, character sheets, etc.)

### 2. Directory Structure Migration (Priority: Critical)
- Create new directory structure mirroring backend/systems/ exactly
- Migrate existing code from current structure to new structure
- Update namespace declarations to match new structure
- Fix all import/using statements to reference new locations
- Remove duplicate/conflicting directories (Faction vs Factions, Quest vs Quests, etc.)

### 3. Frontend System Implementation (Priority: High)
- Implement client-side components for each backend system following patterns:
  - Models/DTOs for API communication
  - Services for HTTP/WebSocket communication with backend
  - UI components for user interaction
  - Integration layers for Unity-specific concerns
- Create standardized API consumption patterns
- Implement real-time synchronization via WebSocket where needed

### 4. Essential UI Components (Priority: High)
- Main Menu system with game creation, loading, settings
- HUD overlay with health, resources, time display
- World/Region map interface with zoom controls
- Character management interface (creation, progression, relationships)
- Inventory and equipment management UI
- Quest log and tracking interface
- Dialogue system UI with conversation trees
- Faction relationship and diplomacy interface
- Settings and configuration panels

### 5. Integration & Testing (Priority: Medium)
- Create comprehensive tests for all migrated components
- Implement integration tests between frontend and backend
- Performance testing for API communication
- User experience testing for UI components
- Documentation updates for new architecture

### Unity-Specific Components
- Bootstrap/ - Game initialization and startup
- Core/ - Unity-specific core systems
- UI/ - User interface framework and components
- Integration/ - System integration and communication layers
- Services/ - Unity service layer for backend communication

### Performance Requirements
- API calls should complete within 200ms for responsive UI
- WebSocket reconnection within 5 seconds of disconnect
- UI should remain responsive during backend operations
- Memory usage should not exceed 2GB for client
- Frame rate should maintain 60fps during normal gameplay

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with Unity 2022.3 LTS
- All API communication must be asynchronous
- UI must be scalable across different screen resolutions
- Code must follow established C# and Unity best practices
- Must support both single-player and multiplayer modes

## Success Criteria

### Completion Metrics
- 100% of backend systems have corresponding frontend structure
- All existing functionality preserved after migration
- Zero compilation errors after refactoring
- All tests passing after migration
- All essential UI components implemented and functional

### Quality Metrics
- Developer can navigate from backend system to frontend counterpart in <10 seconds
- New developer onboarding time reduced by 50%
- Code review time reduced due to consistent patterns
- Bug reports related to frontend-backend misalignment reduced to zero

### User Experience Metrics
- All core game functionality accessible through intuitive UI
- Response time for user actions under 100ms
- No visual glitches or UI inconsistencies
- Smooth transitions between different game states

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items
- Breaking existing functionality during migration
- Performance degradation from new architecture
- Extended development timeline due to scope

### Mitigation Strategies
- Incremental migration with frequent testing
- Backup of existing structure before changes
- Performance benchmarking throughout process
- Regular stakeholder check-ins to manage scope

## Timeline Estimates

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning (1 week)
- Development bible analysis
- Backend structure mapping
- Migration planning
- UI component identification

### Phase 2: Core Migration (2 weeks)
- Directory structure creation
- Code migration and namespace updates
- Basic API service implementation
- Integration testing

### Phase 3: UI Implementation (2 weeks)
- Essential UI component creation
- User experience testing
- Performance optimization
- Documentation updates

### Phase 4: Testing & Polish (1 week)
- Comprehensive testing
- Bug fixes and optimization
- Final documentation
- Stakeholder review

Total estimated timeline: 6 weeks

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Unity 2022.3 LTS must remain stable
- Backend API contracts must be finalized
- Network infrastructure must support WebSocket connections

### Internal Dependencies
- Backend systems must be functional for integration testing
- Development environment must be properly configured
- Team must be aligned on new architectural patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
- Complete directory structure alignment with backend
- All existing functionality preserved
- Essential UI components implemented
- Zero compilation errors
- Performance within acceptable ranges
