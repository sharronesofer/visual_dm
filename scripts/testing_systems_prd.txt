# Visual DM Backend Systems Testing and Fixing Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on achieving 90% test coverage for all modules in `/backend/systems/` while fixing any errors, implementing missing logic, and ensuring proper import structure. The goal is to create a robust, well-tested backend system that follows the development guidelines outlined in the development_bible.md.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Test Coverage Goals
- Achieve 90% test coverage for all modules in `/backend/systems/`
- Fix all existing test errors and import issues
- Ensure all tests are properly located in `/backend/tests/` structure
- Remove any misplaced test directories within `/backend/systems/`

### 2. Import Structure Cleanup
- All Python imports should point to established subdirectories within `/backend/systems/`
- Fix any imports pointing outside the `/backend/systems/` directory
- Ensure canonical implementation patterns are followed
- Remove any erroneous references to files in incorrect directories

### 3. Missing Logic Implementation
- Implement any missing logic using development_bible.md as the authoritative guide
- Ensure all systems follow the design philosophy and technical framework
- Implement missing functionality for character system, combat system, magic system, etc.
- Follow the established patterns for each system type

### 4. Error Resolution
- Fix all test collection errors and import failures
- Resolve ModuleNotFoundError issues
- Fix pytest plugin definition errors
- Ensure all tests can run successfully

## Systems to be Tested and Fixed

19. **Diplomacy System** - Inter-faction relationships and negotiations
20. **Memory System** - NPC memory of player actions and events
21. **Population System** - Settlement demographics and growth

### Economic and Resource Systems
22. **Economy System** - Currency, trade, and market simulation
23. **Crafting System** - Item creation through recipes and skills

### Narrative and Content Systems
24. **Quest System** - Mission generation, progression, and rewards
25. **Rumor System** - Information propagation with varying accuracy
26. **Motif System** - Narrative themes and recurring elements
27. **Religion System** - Deities, practices, and divine intervention

### Conflict and Tension Systems
28. **Tension/War System** - Conflict escalation and battle simulation

### Support Systems
29. **Analytics System** - Gameplay data collection and analysis
30. **Auth/User System** - Authentication and user management
31. **LLM System** - AI integration for dynamic content

## Technical Requirements

### Testing Standards
- Use pytest as the testing framework
- Implement unit tests for individual functions and classes
- Create integration tests for system interactions
- Include edge case and error condition testing
- Follow the test coverage requirements from development_bible.md

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow the modular design principles
- Ensure proper error handling and logging
- Implement proper type hints where applicable
- Follow the established coding patterns and conventions

### Import Structure Requirements
- All imports must reference `/backend/systems/` subdirectories
- No imports from outside the canonical system structure
- Proper use of relative imports within systems
- Clean separation between systems using the events system for loose coupling

### Documentation Requirements
- Update system documentation as logic is implemented
- Ensure all new functions have proper docstrings
- Update the development_bible.md if new patterns emerge
- Document any deviations from the original design

## Success Criteria

1. **Coverage Achievement**: All systems reach 90% test coverage
2. **Error Resolution**: All test collection and import errors are fixed
3. **Logic Completeness**: All missing functionality is implemented according to development_bible.md
4. **Import Compliance**: All imports follow the canonical structure
5. **Test Organization**: All tests are properly located in `/backend/tests/` structure
6. **System Integration**: All systems work together through proper event-based communication

## Dependencies and Relationships

The systems have natural dependencies that should be respected:

### Foundation Layer (No dependencies)
- Shared System
- Events System
- Data System
- Storage System

### Core Game Layer (Depends on Foundation)
- Character System
- Time System
- World Generation System

### Gameplay Layer (Depends on Core Game)
- Combat System (depends on Character)
- Magic System (depends on Character)
- Equipment System (depends on Character)
- Inventory System (depends on Character, Equipment)

### World Simulation Layer (Depends on Gameplay)
- Region System (depends on World Generation)
- POI System (depends on Region, World Generation)
- World State System (depends on POI, Region)

### Social Layer (Depends on World Simulation)
- NPC System (depends on Character, POI)
- Faction System (depends on NPC)
- Population System (depends on NPC, POI)

### Interaction Layer (Depends on Social)
- Dialogue System (depends on NPC)
- Diplomacy System (depends on Faction)
- Memory System (depends on NPC)

### Economic Layer (Depends on Interaction)
- Economy System (depends on Population, POI)
- Crafting System (depends on Equipment, Economy)
- Loot System (depends on Equipment, Economy)

### Content Layer (Depends on Economic)
- Quest System (depends on NPC, Faction, Economy)
- Rumor System (depends on NPC, Population)
- Religion System (depends on Faction, NPC)

### Advanced Layer (Depends on Content)
- Motif System (depends on Quest, NPC)
- Tension/War System (depends on Faction, Diplomacy)

### Support Layer (Can depend on any)
- Analytics System
- Auth/User System
- LLM System

## Implementation Approach

1. **Foundation First**: Start with core infrastructure systems
2. **Layer by Layer**: Work through dependency layers systematically
3. **Test-Driven**: Write/fix tests before implementing missing logic
4. **Incremental**: Complete each system fully before moving to dependents
5. **Integration**: Test system interactions as layers are completed

This approach ensures that dependencies are satisfied and that each system is fully functional before dependent systems are implemented.
