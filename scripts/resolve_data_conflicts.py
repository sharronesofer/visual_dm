"""
Script to resolve conflicting data files by determining canonical versions
and archiving the non-canonical ones.

Analysis of conflicts:
1. README.md - backend version (83 lines) vs root version (42 lines) - backend is more comprehensive
2. balance_constants.json - root version is more comprehensive and used by code
3. goals/None_goals.json - likely test data, need to check which is more current
4. religion/memberships.json - need to check usage
5. religion/religions.json - both seem similar but different IDs, keep both with merge
6. equipment/items.json - both are empty {}, keep root version
