# Procedural Building Generation System PRD

## Overview
The Procedural Building Generation System will create and manage dynamically generated buildings and structures within Points of Interest (POIs), providing varied and contextually appropriate environments for different gameplay scenarios.

## Core Features

### 1. Building Type Definitions
- Social POI Buildings:
  - Inns (lodging, quest hub)
  - Shops (trade, equipment)
  - Taverns (social interaction, information)
  - Guild Halls (faction headquarters)
  - NPC Homes (residential areas)
- Dungeon POI Structures:
  - Enemy Lairs (combat encounters)
  - Puzzle Rooms (player challenges)
  - Treasure Chambers (rewards)
  - Trap Rooms (hazards)
- Exploration POI Features:
  - Ruins (discovery, lore)
  - Campsites (rest points)
  - Landmarks (navigation points)
  - Resource Nodes (gathering points)

### 2. Generation Parameters
- Building Quantity Factors:
  - POI Danger Level (1-20)
  - POI Category (Social, Dungeon, Exploration)
  - Narrative Context (story requirements)
  - Area Size Constraints
- Distribution Density Rules:
  - Social: High density, organized layout
  - Dungeon: Medium density, strategic layout
  - Exploration: Low density, organic spread

### 3. Spatial Layout Algorithm
- Category-Specific Placement Rules:
  - Social:
    - Central plaza or marketplace
    - Connected road network
    - Building clusters by function
  - Dungeon:
    - Entrance/exit pathfinding
    - Guard post positioning
    - Hidden room placement
  - Exploration:
    - Natural formation integration
    - Line-of-sight considerations
    - Resource node distribution
- Collision Detection:
  - Building footprint validation
  - Minimum spacing requirements
  - Terrain compatibility checks

### 4. Interior Generation
- Theme-Based Templates:
  - Room layouts by building type
  - Furniture placement rules
  - Decoration schemes
- Functional Requirements:
  - NPC placement zones
  - Interactive object locations
  - Navigation paths
- Customization Parameters:
  - Size variations
  - Style modifications
  - Purpose-driven layouts

### 5. Persistence and State Management
- Building Data Storage:
  - Location coordinates
  - Interior layouts
  - State information
- Session Continuity:
  - Consistent building access
  - State preservation
  - Modification tracking

### 6. Event Integration
- Narrative Hooks:
  - Quest trigger points
  - NPC encounter zones
  - Dynamic event locations
- Building-Specific Events:
  - Social gatherings
  - Combat scenarios
  - Discovery events

### 7. Monitoring and Analytics
- Generation Logging:
  - Building placement data
  - Layout statistics
  - Performance metrics
- Debug Information:
  - Error tracking
  - Generation failures
  - Optimization data

## Technical Requirements

### Data Storage
- Efficient building template storage
- Fast retrieval of building states
- Reliable persistence layer

### Performance Targets
- Generation time < 2 seconds per building
- Layout calculation < 5 seconds per POI
- Smooth real-time updates

### Security Considerations
- Server-side validation
- Anti-cheat measures
- Data integrity checks

## Success Metrics
- Building variety score > 80%
- Player navigation satisfaction > 90%
- Generation performance within targets
- Bug reports < 1% of generations
