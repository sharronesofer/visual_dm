System Review and Task Generation PRD

Overview:
Implement a systematic review process for all codebase systems, generating targeted questions and follow-up tasks to improve system quality, integration, and maintainability.

Objectives:
1. Create a comprehensive review framework for evaluating each system in the codebase
2. Generate detailed, system-specific questions covering key aspects of implementation and design
3. Process review responses to identify gaps and areas for improvement
4. Generate actionable tasks for addressing identified issues
5. Maintain clear documentation of the review process and outcomes

Key Requirements:

1. Review Framework
   - Develop a standardized review template covering all required aspects
   - Create system-specific question sets based on the template
   - Support both automated and manual review processes
   - Maintain review history and outcomes
   - Track review completion status for each system

2. Question Generation System
   - Generate minimum 10 detailed questions per system
   - Cover all specified review areas:
     * Functionality and implementation completeness
     * Standards adherence and schema consistency
     * Integration clarity
     * Edge case handling
     * Scalability/performance
     * Logging/debugging
     * Maintainability/readability
   - Support system-specific question customization
   - Allow for question prioritization
   - Enable question versioning for iterative improvements

3. Response Processing
   - Capture and store review responses
   - Analyze responses for common patterns
   - Identify critical issues and gaps
   - Track response completeness
   - Support response updates and revisions

4. Task Generation
   - Create detailed tasks based on review findings
   - Prioritize tasks based on issue severity
   - Link tasks to specific systems and review responses
   - Support task dependencies and relationships
   - Enable task tracking and status updates

5. Documentation and Reporting
   - Generate review summary reports
   - Maintain review history per system
   - Track task generation and completion
   - Support metrics and analytics
   - Enable export of review data

Technical Requirements:

1. System Integration
   - Integrate with existing task management system
   - Support version control system integration
   - Enable code analysis tool integration
   - Support documentation system integration
   - Allow for CI/CD pipeline integration

2. Data Management
   - Store review templates and questions
   - Maintain review responses and history
   - Track task relationships and dependencies
   - Support data export and backup
   - Enable data analysis and reporting

3. User Interface
   - Provide clear review interface
   - Support question management
   - Enable response capture and editing
   - Display task generation results
   - Show review progress and metrics

4. Performance Requirements
   - Handle large number of systems and reviews
   - Support concurrent review sessions
   - Maintain responsive UI during processing
   - Enable efficient data querying
   - Support incremental updates

5. Security Requirements
   - Control access to review data
   - Track review modifications
   - Protect sensitive information
   - Enable audit logging
   - Support user authentication
