# Visual DM 6 – AI-Driven UI and Animation System

## Summary
This document outlines the production specification for integrating AI-generated UI elements and animations into Visual DM 6. The goal is to implement a stylized, diegetic interface inspired by an old fantasy book, complete with animated page transitions, reusable sprite systems, and consistent asset pipelines. It also details tooling and workflows for automation, layout design, and sprite management.

## Features

### 1. Dual Animation Layers
- **Region/World Layer**: 
  - Top-down symbolic tiles (e.g. terrain, POIs).
  - Static images only, generated procedurally.
  - Tools: PixelOver, Scenario.gg.

- **POI/Building Layer**:
  - 3/4 view animated sprites used in both exploration and combat.
  - Shared sprite format for reuse.
  - Tools: Leonardo.ai or Scenario.gg for base sprites, ControlNet + AnimateDiff for animation, PixelOver for cleanup.

### 2. Sprite System
- Base sprite: Consistent format (e.g. 64×64, 4x2 walk grid).
- Multiple **walk styles** (e.g. confident, limping, shuffling) generated via ControlNet using pose/edge/depth conditioning.
- Styles assigned per NPC, randomly or based on traits.
- Small vs large NPCs use same styles; animation speed is adjusted rather than image scaling.

### 3. UI Theme and Structure
- Visuals mimic a parchment-style medieval book.
- Menus are framed like pages with illuminated margins and stylized text.
- Each menu screen transition uses a **page-turn animation**.

- Tools:
  - **Leonardo.ai / Midjourney**: Generate parchment, borders, book motifs.
  - **Figma**: Layout UI using assets, define coordinates, export JSON layout.
  - **PixelOver / aseprite**: Cleanup, grid alignment, sprite formatting.

### 4. Page-Turn Animation System
- Frame-by-frame pseudo-animations at 4–8 fps.
- Generated using **ControlNet + AnimateDiff**:
  - Inputs: edge maps (Canny) or depth maps (MiDaS) extracted from hand-drawn or AI-rendered keyframes.
  - Outputs: curved, turning page sequences matching style.
- Playback managed via a `PageTurnMenu` class in runtime code.

### 5. Asset Management and Layout Integration
- Asset folders:
/assets/
/sprites/
/ui/
/animations/

- Naming convention: lowercase, descriptive, consistent (e.g., `npc_guard_walk_east_01.png`)
- UI layout exported from Figma as structured JSON for runtime positioning.
- TexturePacker used for atlasing and performance optimization.
- Git LFS used for asset version control.

### 6. AI Tools and Usage Summary
| Task                       | Tool                        |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Static sprite gen         | Leonardo.ai / Scenario.gg   |
| Animated walk cycles      | ControlNet + AnimateDiff    |
| Page-turn animations      | ControlNet + AnimateDiff    |
| Edge/Depth map gen        | Canny / MiDaS (ComfyUI/A1111)|
| Asset cleanup             | PixelOver / aseprite        |
| UI layout design          | Figma                       |
| Layout export             | JSON from Figma / manual    |
| Sprite atlas generation   | TexturePacker               |

## Deliverables
- PageTurnMenu animation manager class
- Sprite loader with walk-style handling
- Figma-derived JSON UI layout loader
- ComfyUI/AnimateDiff pipeline for walk + transition animation generation
- Asset repository organized by this schema
- Sample output: 2 UI screens with functional transitions, 3 walk styles applied to 5 sprite types

## Constraints
- All animations must use frame-based sprite sheets.
- No runtime morphing or real-time physics for UI.
- Maintain pixel resolution fidelity (no scaling/stretching).
- Runtime performance must allow sub-100ms UI transitions.

## Additional Asset & Placeholder Documentation

For comprehensive planning and implementation of assets and placeholders, please consult the following documents:

- [Hex-Based Map Asset Inventory](../docs/hex_asset_inventory.md):
  - **Purpose:** Draft inventory of all required asset categories for region and combat/POI hex maps, including asset type, example, dimensions, color palette, style notes, and usage notes.
  - **Usage:** Use this as a reference for asset creation, sprite management, and ensuring consistency across map systems. Update as new requirements emerge.

- [Unimplemented Placeholders for Pre-Visual Asset Game Testing](../docs/unimplemented_placeholders.md):
  - **Purpose:** Lists all game systems/components that require manual or specialist placeholder creation, as they cannot be generated automatically with ASCII or simple programmatic means.
  - **Usage:** Reference this list to coordinate with specialists (UI/UX, animation, VFX, accessibility, audio, AI) for manual asset or placeholder creation. Update as new systems are added or requirements change.

**Guidance:**
- Review these documents during asset planning, task breakdown, and implementation phases.
- Update the inventory and placeholder list as the project evolves.
- Ensure all team members are aware of manual requirements and specialist involvement for non-automatable assets.

  - *Mitigation*: Create guidance for using Flask or other Python web frameworks as alternatives.

- **Type Safety Loss**: Python's dynamic typing is less strict than TypeScript.
  - *Mitigation*: Use Python type hints extensively and provide guidance on type checking tools.

## Implementation Risks
- **Conversion Accuracy**: Automated conversions may not handle all edge cases.
  - *Mitigation*: Build a comprehensive test suite with diverse TypeScript patterns.

- **Library Compatibility**: npm packages won't have direct Python equivalents.
  - *Mitigation*: Create a mapping of common libraries and alternatives.

- **Steam Integration**: Python apps need specific handling for Steam integration.
  - *Mitigation*: Provide detailed guidance on Steam SDK usage with Python.

# Appendix

## TypeScript to Python Type Mappings
- string → str
- number → float
- boolean → bool
- any → Any
- void → None
- Array<T> → List[T]
- Record<K,V> → Dict[K,V]
- undefined/null → None
- interface → class
- enum → Enum class

## Common npm to pip Package Mappings
- axios → requests
- lodash → pydash
- moment → python-dateutil
- express → flask
- react → (No direct equivalent, using Flask templates)

## Steam Integration Considerations
- Python GUI frameworks compatible with Steam (PyGame, PyQt)
- Steam Overlay integration techniques
- Steam achievements and leaderboard API access
- Save data and Cloud storage integration
