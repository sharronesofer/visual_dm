# Dynamic Loot Generation System PRD

## Overview
The Dynamic Loot Generation System will provide a flexible, balanced, and engaging reward mechanism for Visual DM, handling loot distribution across various game contexts including chests, shops, and combat encounters.

## Core Features

### 1. Loot Table Structure
- Implement hierarchical loot tables organized by:
  - Danger Level (DL) ranging from 1-20
  - Location types (dungeons, cities, wilderness)
  - Context (shops, chests, combat)
  - Thematic categories (magic, mundane, cultural)
- Support for rarity tiers:
  - Common (60%)
  - Uncommon (25%)
  - Rare (10%)
  - Epic (4%)
  - Legendary (1%)

### 2. Dynamic Generation Triggers
- Chest Discovery: Generate loot when players interact with chest objects
- Shop Refresh: Daily or game-cycle based inventory updates
- Combat Resolution: Immediate loot generation post-combat
- Special Events: Quest rewards, treasure hoards, etc.

### 3. Contextual Adaptation
- Scale loot quality with party level and individual character progression
- Consider character classes, backgrounds, and feats
- Adjust for location themes and story context
- Factor in player choices and reputation systems

### 4. Persistence & State Management
- Track opened/unopened state of chests
- Maintain shop inventory states between refreshes
- Record loot history for balancing
- Support save/load functionality

### 5. Security & Validation
- Server-side validation of all loot generation
- Anti-exploitation measures
- Transaction logging
- Inventory state verification

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Systems
- RESTful API endpoints for loot generation and management
- Database schema for loot tables and state tracking

- State tracking for containers and shops
- Player interaction history
- Balance adjustment parameters

### Security Measures
- Request validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting on generation requests
- Transaction atomicity
- State verification checks
