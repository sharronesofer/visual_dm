# Event System Refactoring PRD

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to refactor the `/backend/systems/events` directory to make it more consistent and organized by consolidating duplicate modules and overlapping implementations.

## Current Issues
1. Multiple overlapping event dispatcher implementations:
   - `dispatcher.py` - A basic event dispatcher without thread safety
   - `event_dispatcher.py` - Both a deprecated wrapper and an implementation
   - `enhanced_event_dispatcher.py` - A thread-safe implementation with additional features
   - `base.py` - Contains both a deprecated wrapper and event base classes
2. The README indicates that the canonical implementation should be in `backend/app/core/events/event_dispatcher.py`
3. Inconsistent interfaces and implementations across files
4. Potential thread safety issues in some implementations
5. Lack of consistent error handling and middleware support

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Create a consolidated event system implementation that combines the best features of all existing versions
2. Maintain backward compatibility where possible
3. Ensure thread safety throughout the implementation
4. Implement comprehensive error handling
5. Support both synchronous and asynchronous event handling
6. Provide middleware support for cross-cutting concerns

### Technical Requirements
1. Create a `canonical_event_dispatcher.py` file that combines functionality from:
   - dispatcher.py
   - event_dispatcher.py
   - enhanced_event_dispatcher.py
2. Implement a thread-safe singleton pattern for the event dispatcher
3. Support both class-based and string-based event subscriptions
4. Implement a middleware system for common cross-cutting concerns:
   - Logging
   - Error handling
   - Event filtering
   - Analytics
5. Provide a clean migration path from the existing implementations
6. Update the `__init__.py` file to export the new canonical classes
7. Add deprecation warnings for legacy imports

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. Code should be well-documented with docstrings and comments
2. Files should follow a consistent naming and organization pattern
3. Type hints should be used throughout the codebase
4. Performance should be optimized, especially for high-frequency events

## Success Criteria
1. All existing functionality remains working
2. Reduced number of files with clearer organization
3. No duplicate code across the event system
4. Improved maintainability and readability
5. Thread-safe implementation
6. Comprehensive error handling
7. Support for middleware
8. Clean migration path from existing implementations
