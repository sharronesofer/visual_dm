# Test Runner Results

## Summary
The test runner was successfully implemented to scan for and run all tests in the backend directory, both in the standard `backend/tests/` directory and scattered throughout the backend module folders. However, there are several issues preventing successful test execution.

## Successful Components
- The test discovery mechanism is working correctly, finding 90+ test files outside the standard test directory
- The pytest configuration was fixed to remove syntax errors in the `pytest.ini` file
- The memory categories implementation was updated to include missing functions required by tests

## Issues Preventing Successful Test Execution

### Configuration Issues
- Some pytest configuration values had inline comments causing parsing issues
- The `xvs` setting in pytest.ini is unrecognized and should be removed or changed
- There are deprecated API warnings related to Pydantic v2 that should be addressed

### Mock-Related Issues
- Many async tests fail with `TypeError: object MagicMock can't be used in 'await' expression`
- This suggests the test fixtures need updating to work correctly with async functions
- The mock storage and event dispatcher implementations don't properly support async operations

### Import/Module Structure Issues
- Multiple `ModuleNotFoundError` errors indicate potential package structure problems
- Some imports reference modules that don't exist in the current structure
- Deprecated imports are being used in several places

### Test/Implementation Mismatches
- Several tests expect specific functions, properties, or behavior that isn't present in the actual implementation
- Tests for the memory system make assumptions about the Memory model that don't match the actual implementation
- Some assertion thresholds may need adjusting based on the current implementation

## Recommendations

1. **Fix pytest.ini Configuration**
   - Remove inline comments from configuration values
   - Update deprecated settings

2. **Update Mock Implementations for Async Tests**
   - Create proper async mock implementations for storage and event dispatchers
   - Use AsyncMock instead of MagicMock for async methods

3. **Resolve Import Structure**
   - Review and update the import paths in tests to match the current module structure
   - Fix deprecated imports to use the current recommended paths

4. **Align Tests with Implementation**
   - Update tests to match the current implementation or vice versa
   - Review assertion thresholds and expected values

5. **Install Missing Dependencies**
   - Ensure all required packages for tests are installed

## Suggested Next Steps

1. Start by fixing the most basic test issues (pytest configuration, import paths)
2. Create or update a requirements-dev.txt file with all test dependencies
3. Fix async mock implementations to properly support await expressions
4. Update tests for one system at a time, starting with core systems like events and memory
5. Consider running tests in isolation (one system at a time) until all systems are fixed
