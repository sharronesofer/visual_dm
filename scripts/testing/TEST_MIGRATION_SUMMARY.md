# Test Migration Summary

## Overview

After running the migration script, we discovered that most test files already exist in both locations:
1. Within system directories (`backend/systems/<system_name>/tests/`)
2. In the centralized test structure (`backend/tests/systems/<system_name>/`)

## Key Findings

1. **Analytics System** - Some test files were identical and could be safely removed from the source location, while others had differences and require manual review.

2. **Widespread Duplication** - Every system with tests had duplicated test files in both locations.

3. **File Differences** - Most test files had differences between the source and target locations, requiring manual review.

4. **No Missing Tests** - All test files have already been copied to the centralized location, so no files needed to be moved for the first time.

## Recommendation Plan

Based on these findings, we recommend the following approach:

1. **Manual Review Process**:
   - For each pair of files marked for manual review, use a diff tool to identify differences
   - Determine which version is more up-to-date or complete
   - Update the version in the centralized test structure if necessary
   - Remove the version in the system directory

2. **Update Documentation**:
   - Ensure READMEs in the original locations clearly indicate where tests have moved
   - Update the central test documentation to explain the new structure

3. **Fix Script Issues**:
   - The script had some issues with string substitution in the README generation
   - Fix these issues before using it for other migrations

4. **Update Test Runners**:
   - Ensure CI/CD pipelines and test runners only look for tests in the centralized location
   - Update any direct test references in documentation or scripts

## Path Forward

1. Prioritize the manual review of test files in systems that are actively being developed
2. Coordinate with the development team to ensure everyone is aware of the centralized test structure
3. Update test-related documentation to reflect the new structure
4. Fix the script issues and rerun for any future test migrations

## Systems Requiring Manual Review

The following systems have test files requiring manual review:

- analytics
- character
- combat
- crafting
- data
- dialogue
- economy
- events
- loot
- motif
- poi
- quest
- rumor
- tension_war
- time
- world_state

This represents all systems with tests, indicating this is a widespread issue requiring a systematic approach to resolution.
