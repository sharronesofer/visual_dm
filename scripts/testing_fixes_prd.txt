# Dreamforge Testing and Fix System PRD

## Overview

Dreamforge is a complex Python application for Dungeon Masters that has a large codebase with multiple interconnected systems. The application currently has numerous test failures that need to be addressed systematically. This PRD outlines a plan to create a comprehensive testing and fix system that will identify, categorize, and resolve these issues through automated batch scripts.

## Objectives

1. Create a robust testing framework that identifies all failures in the codebase
2. Develop automated batch fix scripts that can address common patterns of failures
3. Implement a tracking system to measure progress and prioritize fixes
4. Document all fixes and patterns to prevent regressions
5. Ensure consistent implementation of SQLAlchemy models, Pydantic validations, and imports

## Requirements

### Testing Infrastructure

1. The system must provide comprehensive test reporting with categorization of failures
2. Tests should be executable in isolation or as groups for specific subsystems
3. Test reports should identify patterns of failures and suggest batch fix strategies
4. The system must track progress over time to show improvements

### Batch Fix Scripts

1. Create scripts to handle common failure patterns:
   - SQLAlchemy model conflicts (add extend_existing=True)
   - Missing imports
   - Pydantic model configuration issues
   - Function stubs for unimplemented features
   - Mock data generation for testing
   
2. Scripts must be:
   - Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
   - Selective (can target specific files or patterns)
   - Verbose (log all changes made)
   - Reversible (create backups or be undo-able)

### Tracking and Documentation

1. Implement a tracking system to measure test pass/fail rates over time
2. Document all identified failure patterns and their solutions
3. Create a summary report of fixes applied and remaining issues
4. Establish guidelines for preventing similar issues in future development

### Model and Schema Consistency

1. Ensure all SQLAlchemy models follow consistent patterns
2. Standardize Pydantic model configurations
3. Fix circular import issues
4. Create proper type hints and annotations

## Success Criteria

1. All previously failing tests now pass or are properly skipped with documentation
2. Batch fix scripts successfully handle at least 80% of common failure patterns
3. Complete documentation of all fixes and remaining issues
4. Testing system integrated into CI/CD workflow
5. Guidelines established to prevent regressions

## Timeline

This project should be completed in phases:

1. Initial Analysis and Planning (Week 1)
2. Batch Script Development (Weeks 2-3)
3. Implementation and Testing (Weeks 3-4)
4. Documentation and Finalization (Week 5)

## Technical Specifications

### Technology Stack

- Python 3.9+
- pytest for testing
- Custom Python scripts for batch fixes
- Shell scripts for automation
- SQLAlchemy and Pydantic for data models
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

### Key Components

1. Test Runner System
2. Batch Fix Script Library
3. Reporting and Tracking Dashboard
4. Documentation Generator

## Future Considerations

1. Integration with IDE plugins for real-time feedback
2. AI-assisted code repair recommendations
3. Expanded test coverage for edge cases
4. Performance benchmarking during tests
