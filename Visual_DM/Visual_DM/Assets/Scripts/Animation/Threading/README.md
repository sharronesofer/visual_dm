# Animation Threading System

## Overview
This system provides a high-performance, multi-threaded job and thread pool architecture for Unity 2D animation, supporting parallel skinning, job dependencies, and runtime configuration.

## Architecture
- **ThreadPoolManager**: Manages worker threads and a priority-based work queue.
- **AnimationJobSystem**: Handles job submission, dependency management, and load balancing.
- **AnimationTask**: Base class for all animation jobs, supporting priorities and dependencies.
- **ParallelSkinningJob**: Specialized job for SIMD-optimized skinning.
- **AnimationStateBuffer**: Double-buffered, thread-safe state for animation poses.
- **AnimationMetrics**: Performance monitoring and logging.
- **AnimationThreadingConfig**: Runtime configuration for thread count and logging.

## Thread Safety
- All job execution is thread-safe and uses lock-free or atomic operations where possible.
- Shared animation state uses double-buffering and atomic swaps.
- Critical updates use Interlocked or read-write locks as needed.

## Deadlock Avoidance
- No blocking waits in worker threads; all waits are non-blocking or time-limited.
- Job dependencies are managed as a DAG to prevent cycles.
- All shared resources are accessed via lock-free or fine-grained locking.

## Integration
- Backward compatible with existing animation calls.
- Synchronization points are provided for rendering pipeline integration.
- Asset management integration hooks are included for Task #586.
- Thread count and logging can be adjusted at runtime.

## Extending
- Add new job types by inheriting from `AnimationTask`.
- Use `AnimationJobSystem.Submit()` for non-blocking job submission.
- Monitor performance via `AnimationMetrics`.

## Testing
- Unit, integration, performance, and stress tests are recommended (see test stubs in `Tests/`).
