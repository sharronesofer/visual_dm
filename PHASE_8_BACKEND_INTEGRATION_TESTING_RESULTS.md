## Backend Integration Architecture

### Service Discovery Process
```
Discovery Phase:
├── Production Backend Health Check  → /health endpoint validation
├── Mock Server Health Check         → Fallback service verification
├── Service Status Tracking          → Real-time status monitoring
└── Optimal Backend Selection        → Intelligent service selection
```

### Integration Management Flow
```
Integration Process:
1. Service Discovery        → Detect available backends
2. Backend Selection        → Choose optimal service
3. Service Configuration    → Update client endpoints
4. Integration Testing      → Validate functionality
5. Health Monitoring        → Continuous service health
```

### Fallback Mechanism
```
Fallback Logic:
Production Available    → Use Production Backend
Production Failed       → Automatic fallback to Mock
Mock Available          → Continue with Mock services
No Services Available   → Offline mode with graceful degradation
```
