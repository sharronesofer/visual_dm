- **Computational Load:** 10.0 CPU units per hour
- **Memory Usage:** 2.5 MB per NPC
- **Systems:** Full AI processing, conversation, all game systems
- **Behavior:** Complete personality simulation, complex decision-making
- **Promotion:** Immediate upon any player interaction
- **Demotion:** After 1 hour of no player interaction

#### Tier 2: Background NPCs (up to 11 hours since interaction)
- **Computational Load:** 2.0 CPU units per hour (80% reduction)
- **Memory Usage:** 1.0 MB per NPC (60% reduction)
- **Systems:** Economy, basic diplomacy, visual presence maintained
- **Behavior:** Simplified decision-making, background activities
- **Promotion:** When player enters POI (from Tier 4) or player interaction
- **Demotion:** After 11 hours total since last interaction

#### Tier 3: Dormant NPCs (12+ hours since interaction)
- **Computational Load:** 0.1 CPU units per hour (99% reduction)
- **Memory Usage:** 0.2 MB per NPC (92% reduction)
- **Systems:** Economy participation only, visual presence maintained
- **Behavior:** Statistical representation in world systems

- **Memory Usage:** 0.05 MB per NPC (98% reduction)
- **Systems:** Statistical participation only, compressed data storage
- **Behavior:** Minimal world impact, essential data preservation

#### Tier 4: Statistical NPCs (never interacted)
- **Computational Load:** 0.0 CPU units per hour (100% reduction)
- **Memory Usage:** 0.0 MB (database storage only)
- **Systems:** Pure statistics, no individual processing
- **Behavior:** Exist only as population statistics until promoted
- **Promotion:** To Tier 2 when player enters their POI

## Population Scale Architecture

### World Population Targets
- **Minimal:** 50,000 visible NPCs (basic functionality)
- **Standard:** 100,000 visible NPCs (good immersion)
- **Revolutionary:** 200,000 visible NPCs (best-in-class experience)
- **Godlike:** 400,000 visible NPCs (maximum immersion)

### Regional Population Distribution
- **Total Population per Region:** 2,000-5,000 NPCs (10x increase from old system)
- **Visible Population per Region:** 800-2,000 NPCs (Tiers 1-3.5)
- **Statistical Population:** Remainder stored as Tier 4 in database

### Settlement Population Hierarchy
- **Hamlet:** 20-80 NPCs (small communities)
- **Village:** 80-300 NPCs (local centers)
- **Town:** 300-1,200 NPCs (regional hubs)
- **City:** 1,200-5,000 NPCs (major centers)
- **Metropolis:** 5,000-15,000 NPCs (massive urban centers)

### POI Distribution Enhancement
- **Settlements per Region:** 12 (increased from 7)
- **Non-settlement POIs per Region:** 25 (increased from 14)
- **Total POIs per Region:** 37 (increased from 21)

## Memory Retention and Intelligence Preservation

### Critical Design Principle
NPCs retain ALL memories and personality data when demoted. The tier system affects computational allocation, NOT intelligence degradation.

### Memory Management by Tier
- **Tier 1:** Full memory access, active conversation context, complete relationship data
- **Tier 2:** Compressed memory with core personality intact, essential relationships preserved
- **Tier 3:** Core memories and personality summary maintained
- **Tier 3.5:** Essential data only with compressed personality profiles
- **Tier 4:** Complete data stored in database with full restoration capability

### Data Preservation Guarantee
When an NPC is promoted from any tier back to Tier 1, they retain:
- Complete interaction history with all players
- Full personality traits and quirks
- All learned information and experiences
- Relationship networks and social connections
- Personal goals and motivations
- Individual backstory and character development

## Chuck-E-Cheese Activation System

### Revolutionary POI-Based Management

The system implements a "Chuck-E-Cheese curtain" approach where NPCs are activated only when players are present:

#### POI Activation Flow
1. **Player Enters POI:** All Tier 4 NPCs instantly promoted to Tier 2 (become visible)
2. **Player Interacts with NPC:** Specific NPC promoted to Tier 1 (full activation)
3. **Player Leaves POI:** No immediate demotion (natural decay based on timers)
4. **POI Becomes Empty:** NPCs gradually demote based on interaction timers

#### Computational Efficiency
- **Inactive POIs:** 100% of NPCs remain Tier 4 (zero computational cost)
- **Recently Visited POIs:** Mixed tiers based on interaction recency
- **Currently Occupied POIs:** Dynamic tier distribution based on player activity

## System Integration Architecture

### Economy System Integration
- **Tier 1-3:** Full economic participation (buying, selling, price negotiation)
- **Tier 3.5:** Statistical economic participation (aggregate market effects)
- **Tier 4:** No individual economic activity (pure population statistics)

### Diplomacy System Integration
- **Tier 1-2:** Active diplomatic participation (cities/towns only, based on POI type)
- **Tier 3+:** Statistical representation in diplomatic calculations

### Tension/War System Integration
- **Tier 1-2:** Active participation in conflicts, can be recruited, affect morale
- **Tier 3+:** Statistical casualties and war effects only

### Religion System Integration
- **Tier 1-2:** Active religious participation, can be converted, attend ceremonies
- **Tier 3+:** Statistical faith representation in regional religious calculations

### Espionage System Integration
- **Tier 1-2:** Can be recruited as spies (military POIs/cities only)
- **Tier 3+:** Statistical intelligence value and security risks only
