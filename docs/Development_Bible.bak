## Introduction

Visual DM is a tabletop roleplaying game companion/simulation tool that brings to life the worlds, characters, and stories from tabletop RPGs. It emphasizes a robust, modular, and extensible design with a focus on procedural generation, rich NPCs, and immersive storytelling driven by advanced AI.

The goal is to create a virtual world that facilitates an adaptive, living, and dynamic tabletop roleplaying experience. Visual DM allows for traditional GM-led play, solo/GM-less play, or a hybrid approach.
