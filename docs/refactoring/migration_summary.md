# Backend Tests Migration Summary

## Overview

The migration of backend tests from `backend/systems` to `backend/tests/systems` has been completed. This document summarizes the results of the migration.

## Migration Results

- **Total test files moved**: 27
- **Destination structure**: All test files now reside in `backend/tests/systems` in a directory structure that mirrors the original `backend/systems` structure.
- **Original files**: All original test files have been removed from `backend/systems`.
- **Test verification**: 
  - Total tests: 186
  - Passed: 46 (25%)
  - Failed: 140 (75%)

## Analysis of Failing Tests

Most of the failing tests are not failing due to import issues, as our analysis found only 1 file with relative imports. Instead, they are failing due to the following issues:

1. **Missing SQLAlchemy model dependencies**: Many tests are failing with errors like `sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: When initializing mapper Mapper[Resource(resources)], expression 'Region' failed to locate a name ('Region')`. This suggests that when tests are run from the new location, the SQLAlchemy models are not being properly initialized in the correct order.

2. **Different import side effects**: When tests are moved, the order of imports changes, which can affect how models are registered with SQLAlchemy.

3. **Missing fixtures**: Some tests may rely on fixtures defined in the original location.

4. **Path-dependent code**: Some tests may rely on paths relative to their original location.

## Next Steps

The following steps are recommended to address the failing tests:

1. **Fix SQLAlchemy model dependencies**: 
   - Create an `__init__.py` file in each model directory that explicitly imports all models in the correct order to avoid circular dependencies.
   - Consider using SQLAlchemy's `configure_mappers()` function to ensure all mappers are initialized before tests run.

2. **Update test fixtures**: 
   - Ensure all test fixtures are properly available to the tests in their new location.
   - Consider using pytest's `conftest.py` files to define fixtures at different levels of the test hierarchy.

3. **Update path references**: 
   - Check for hardcoded paths in tests and update them to work from the new location.
   - Consider using pathlib's `Path(__file__).parent` for relative paths.

4. **Run tests by system**: 
   - Focus on fixing one system at a time, starting with those that have some passing tests.
   - Use `pytest -k` to run specific test classes or methods.

5. **Update CI/CD configurations**: 
   - Update any CI/CD pipelines to run tests from the new location.

## Detailed Error Analysis

### SQLAlchemy Errors

The most common error is related to SQLAlchemy model initialization:

```
sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: When initializing mapper Mapper[Resource(resources)], expression 'Region' failed to locate a name ('Region'). If this is a class name, consider adding this relationship() to the <class 'backend.systems.economy.models.resource.Resource'> class after both dependent classes have been defined.
```

This suggests that the 'Region' model is being referenced before it's defined. To fix this:

1. Ensure all models are imported in the correct order.
2. Consider using strings for relationship definitions (`relationship("Region")` instead of `relationship(Region)`).
3. Move relationship definitions to a separate function that's called after all models are defined.

### How to Fix One System

Taking the Economy system as an example, to fix it:

1. Create or update `backend/systems/economy/models/__init__.py` to import all models in the correct order.
2. Modify relationship definitions to use string references where needed.
3. Update any test fixtures in `backend/tests/systems/economy/conftest.py`.
4. Run the tests for the Economy system in isolation to verify the fixes.

## Conclusion

The migration of test files from `backend/systems` to `backend/tests/systems` has been completed successfully. The next phase involves fixing the failing tests to ensure they work correctly in their new location. This should be done systematically, focusing on one system at a time, starting with those that have the fewest issues.
