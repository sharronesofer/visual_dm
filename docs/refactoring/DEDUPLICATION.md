# Backend Deduplication

This document summarizes the work done to deduplicate and standardize the backend codebase after restructuring.

## Process Summary

We analyzed the systems in the `/backend/systems` directory to identify duplicate functionality. Our primary focus was on:

1. Identifying and removing duplicate classes and functions
2. Updating import paths to use the new structure
3. Creating missing files needed for cross-system references
4. Standardizing naming conventions

## Key Changes

### 1. Import Path Updates

The most significant issue discovered was outdated import paths rather than actual code duplication. We created and ran `update_imports.py` to systematically update the following import patterns:

- `app.core.database` → `backend.core.database`
- `app.core.models.X` → `backend.systems.X.models.X`
- `app.core.utils` → `backend.core.utils`
- `app.models` → `backend.systems.X.models`

### 2. Duplicate Functionality Removal

#### Auth System

- **Findings**: The auth_user system contained user models and authentication services without duplication across other systems.
- **Actions**: Updated import paths in the auth_user models and services.

#### Character System

- **Findings**: Character functionality was split between multiple directories (character, npc, player_character).
- **Actions**: Consolidated all character-related code into the `backend/systems/character` directory with proper subdirectories.

#### Inventory System

- **Findings**: Found a duplicate `InventoryValidator` class defined in both `inventory_utils.py` and `inventory_validator.py`.
- **Actions**: Removed the duplicate in `inventory_utils.py` and updated it to import from the dedicated validator module.

#### Rumor System

- **Findings**: No duplicate implementations found, but import paths needed updating.
- **Actions**: Updated imports to use the new structure (particularly for the event dispatcher).

#### World State System

- **Findings**: The world state manager relied on schemas from the old structure.
- **Actions**: Created dedicated schema files in their proper locations and updated imports.

### 3. Core System Centralization

To reduce future duplication, we created central implementations of commonly used components:

#### GPT Client

- Observed multiple similar implementations across systems
- Created a unified `backend/core/ai/gpt_client.py` implementation with:
  - Singleton pattern 
  - Improved error handling
  - Better configuration options
  - Support for multiple LLM providers

#### Event System

- Created a central event system at `backend/systems/events/models/event_dispatcher.py`
- Implemented a clean event class hierarchy
- Added proper type hints and documentation

## Future Work

The following items require additional work:

1. **Further Schema Review**: Many systems reference schema types from other systems. More work is needed to ensure these references use the new structure.

2. **Database Models**: Database models need further review to ensure they're using consistent base classes and following project conventions.

3. **Testing**: Unit tests need to be updated to use the new structure.

4. **Documentation**: Systems should have README files documenting their purpose and interfaces.

5. **Domain-Specific Logic**: Each system should be further reviewed to ensure domain-specific logic is not duplicated across systems.

## Next Steps

To complete the deduplication process:

1. **Continue Analysis:** Work through the remaining systems in the same way
2. **Testing:** Add tests to verify functionality after migrations
3. **Documentation:** Update API documentation to reflect new structure 
4. **Database Migrations:** Create migrations for schema changes

## Benefits

The deduplication work:
- Maintains single sources of truth for functionality
- Ensures consistent import paths across the codebase
- Makes the system boundaries cleaner and more explicit
- Facilitates future development with clear organization
