# Narrative Documentation

## Overview
The narrative systems in Visual DM drive emergent storytelling, world events, and character arcs. Narrative is shaped by player actions, AI decisions, motifs, and world state, supporting replayability and deep engagement.

## Narrative Systems
- **Motif System:** Assigns and rotates hidden narrative drivers for regions and NPCs, influencing world events and quest generation.
- **Arc System:** Manages major story arcs (meta-quests) for regions and player characters, with branching and failure states.
- **Memory System:** Tracks and summarizes major events for regions, factions, NPCs, and the world, providing historical context for narrative and gameplay.
- **Belief Generation:** Uses GPT and summarization to create beliefs and rumors from world events and memory logs.

## Motifs & Arcs
- **Motifs:** Hidden narrative drivers that rotate and decay, tracked for both regions and NPCs.
- **Arcs:** Major narrative threads that progress or fail based on player and world actions.
- **Memory:** Core and summarized memories provide context for narrative decisions and world state changes.

## Integration Points
- **AI Systems:** NPCs and world entities use motifs and arcs to drive behavior and quest generation.
- **Worldbuilding:** Regions, factions, and events are shaped by narrative systems.
- **Quest System:** Quests are generated and resolved based on narrative state and motifs.
- **Dialogue System:** GPT-powered conversations reflect and influence narrative state.
- **UI/UX:** Narrative events and state are surfaced through runtime-generated UI and feedback systems.

## Best Practices
- **Emergence:** Design narrative systems to support unexpected, organic storylines.
- **Replayability:** Ensure motifs, arcs, and memory systems create unique experiences each playthrough.
- **Documentation:** Document all narrative systems, motifs, arcs, and integration points. Include usage examples and extension guidelines.
- **Testing:** Implement unit and integration tests for all narrative logic and edge cases.

## Testing & Validation
- **Unit Tests:** Cover all narrative modules (motifs, arcs, memory, etc.).
- **Integration Tests:** Simulate full narrative flows, including motif rotation and arc resolution.
- **Performance Tests:** Profile narrative systems under load and optimize as needed.
- **Manual Playtesting:** Use playtest feedback to refine narrative emergence and engagement.
