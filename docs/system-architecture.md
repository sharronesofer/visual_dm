## Overview
The Inventory Management System is a modular, extensible backend component designed to handle all aspects of item storage, manipulation, and tracking for gameplay and simulation environments. It provides persistent storage, flexible item attributes, inventory constraints, validation, error recovery, logging, and integration points for economic and reputation systems.

## Design Principles
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each module/class has a single responsibility (e.g., storage, validation, event emission).
- **Extensibility:** New features (attributes, events, integrations) can be added with minimal changes to core logic.
- **Transactional Integrity:** All multi-step operations are atomic and rollback on error.
- **Observability:** Comprehensive logging and event emission for audit and integration.
- **Thread Safety:** Query interface and critical operations are safe for concurrent access.
- **Testability:** All components are covered by unit and integration tests.

## Component Interactions
- **InventoryRepository**: Main entry point for CRUD and transactional operations. Coordinates with InventoryContainer, Validator, RecoveryManager, and Logging.
- **InventoryContainer**: Encapsulates inventory logic (constraints, stacking, slotting) and delegates validation.
- **InventoryValidator**: Ensures all operations are valid before execution; raises errors on violations.
- **RecoveryManager**: Detects and fixes data inconsistencies, manages backup/restore.
- **InventoryEventBus**: Emits events for integration with external systems (e.g., economic, reputation).
- **Logging Framework**: Captures all critical operations and state changes for audit and debugging.
- **InventoryQueryInterface**: Provides thread-safe, read-only access for external systems.

## System Boundaries and Constraints
- **Boundaries:**
  - Interfaces with game logic/API layer (input/output)
  - Integrates with external economic and reputation systems via event bus
  - Relies on persistent storage (DB/ORM)
- **Constraints:**
  - Must maintain data integrity and support rollback on failure
  - Must be extensible for new item types, attributes, and integrations
  - Must support high concurrency and large inventories
