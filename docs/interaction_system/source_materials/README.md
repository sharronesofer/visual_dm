# Source Materials for Interaction System

This directory contains all source materials used to document the technical requirements for the Interaction System (Task #482). Each entry below lists the file, its origin, and a brief description of its contents. This README will be updated as files are added or referenced in the requirements documentation process.

## File Index

- scripts_file_list.txt: Inventory of all files in the scripts directory (potential Q&A, technical review, and architectural docs)
- docs_file_list.txt: Inventory of all files in the docs directory (existing documentation)
- tasks_file_list.txt: Inventory of all files in the tasks directory (task-related documentation)
- cursor_file_list.txt: Inventory of all files in the .cursor directory (rules, decision records)
- project_file_list.txt: Inventory of all files in the project (for completeness)

## Next Steps
- Review these inventories to identify and copy relevant Q&A, technical review, and architectural documents into this folder.
- As files are added, update this README with their origin and a brief description.
