Relational Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL):\n   - PostgreSQL offers ACID compliance, strong schema support, advanced indexing, JSONB for flexible data, robust backup/restore, partitioning, materialized views, triggers, and PostGIS for spatial data\n   - Write scaling requires careful partitioning/sharding strategies for very high volumes\n\n2. NoSQL Solutions (MongoDB, Cassandra):\n   - Provide schema flexibility and horizontal scaling with high write throughput (especially Cassandra)\n   - However, they offer weaker consistency guarantees, less robust complex query support, limited referential integrity, and increased operational complexity\n\n3. Time-Series Databases (TimescaleDB, InfluxDB):\n   - Optimized for time-based data and efficient historical queries\n   - Less suitable for complex entity relationships and relational joins\n\nOur decision matrix evaluated these options across multiple criteria:\n- Query Performance: PostgreSQL with proper partitioning, indexing, and materialized views provides excellent performance for both current and historical queries\n- Write Throughput: PostgreSQL offers sufficient throughput for our expected volumes, with scaling options via partitioning and connection pooling\n- Consistency & Integrity: PostgreSQL provides industry-standard strong consistency and referential integrity\n- Extensibility: PostgreSQL supports JSONB for flexible data, schema evolution capabilities, and numerous extensions\n- Operational Maturity: PostgreSQL has a mature ecosystem for backup, monitoring, and recovery\n- Cost: PostgreSQL is open-source with no licensing fees\n\nBased on this evaluation, we've selected PostgreSQL as our primary storage technology for the POI evolution history. For potential future scaling needs with extremely high write volumes or cold data archiving, we may consider supplementing with TimescaleDB (a PostgreSQL extension) or object storage for raw event logs.\n\nThis decision aligns with industry best practices for managing transactional, temporal, and spatial data in modern applications.

Integrate with the central state management system using action creators and reducers\\n6. Add timestamps and metadata to interruption state objects for tracking purposes\\n\\nImplementation Plan for Interruption State Management System:\\n\\n1. **Enumeration of Interruption States**: Define a TypeScript enum (or equivalent) for interruption states such as TEMPORARY_PAUSE, SYSTEM_ERROR, USER_EXIT, etc. This will be the source of truth for all interruption state transitions.\\n\\n2. **State Machine Implementation**: Use a robust state machine pattern (e.g., XState or a custom implementation) to manage transitions between interruption states. Each transition will be validated to prevent illegal state changes. The state machine will emit events on transitions.\\n\\n3. **Event Listeners**: Implement event listeners for both system-level (e.g., browser tab close, network disconnect) and user-initiated interruptions (e.g., clicking a pause or exit button). These listeners will dispatch actions to the state machine.\\n\\n4. **Persistence Layer**: Use localStorage (for browser) or IndexedDB for persisting the current interruption state and relevant metadata. On app load, the system will restore the last known state. The persistence layer will be abstracted for easy adaptation to other platforms.\\n\\n5. **Redux Integration**: Integrate interruption state into the central Redux-style state management. Define actions, reducers, and selectors for interruption state. Ensure all state changes are serializable and compatible with time-travel debugging.\\n\\n6. **Timestamps and Metadata**: Each interruption state object will include a timestamp, triggering event, and optional metadata (e.g., error details, user ID). This will aid in debugging and analytics.\\n\\n7. **Testing**: Plan for unit tests of state transitions, integration tests for persistence, and snapshot tests for state objects.\\n\\n**Next Steps:**\\n- Create the enum and state machine implementation in a new module (e.g., `interruptionState.ts`).\\n- Implement event listeners and persistence logic.\\n- Integrate with Redux and add metadata handling.\\n- Write comprehensive tests for all components.\\n- Ensure proper handoff to the GPT Context Preservation Mechanism in subtask 470.2.\n</info added on 2025-05-16T01:29:28.095Z>",

The architecture documentation will focus on the following structure:\n\n1. System Roles and Responsibilities:\n   - The Interaction System manages all NPC interactions (NPC-to-NPC and NPC-to-environment), handling complex social behaviors including dialogue, trade, mentoring, conflict resolution, social bonding, information sharing, group decisions, negotiation, deception, cooperation, and competition. It integrates with multiple subsystems including DialogueManager, EmotionSystem, ReputationSystem, MemoryManager, GroupFormationSystem, and EconomicAgentSystem.\n   \n   - The POI Evolution System manages the dynamic evolution of Points of Interest based on game events and interactions. It implements rule-based evolution with multiple trigger types (time-based, event-based, and interaction-based) and emits events (notably 'poi:evolved') to signal state changes to other systems. It primarily integrates with the POIManager and relies on an event-driven architecture for cross-system communication.\n\n2. Integration Architecture:\n   - The primary integration mechanism is the central EventBus, where the POI Evolution System emits 'poi:evolved' events that can be consumed by the Interaction System and other game systems.\n   - The Interaction System can indirectly trigger POI evolution by causing interactions that meet evolution rule conditions.\n   - Both systems follow a publish-subscribe pattern, enabling decoupled, asynchronous communication through standardized event payloads.\n\n3. Technical Implementation:\n   - Both systems are built on TypeScript/Node.js backend.\n   - The architecture follows an event-driven design using a custom in-process EventBus (with potential for replacement with RabbitMQ/Kafka for distributed deployments).\n   - Shared data models and TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety across system boundaries.\n   - Key shared resources include the EventBus, POIManager, and typed event interfaces (POIEvents, InteractionContext, etc.).\n\nThe architecture diagram will visualize these components, showing the event flow between systems and highlighting the decoupled nature of the integration. I'll complete the diagram using Lucidchart and incorporate it into the final documentation along with detailed descriptions of each component and integration point.\n</info added on 2025-05-16T03:23:19.381Z>",

InteractionContext (TypeScript interface):\n```typescript\nexport interface InteractionContext {\n  npcId: string;\n  targetId: string;\n  type: InteractionType;\n  subtype?: string;\n  data?: any;\n  location?: string;\n  time?: number;\n  witnesses?: string[];\n  socialContext?: {\n    relationship: number;\n    groupContext?: {\n      groupId: string;\n      role: string;\n    };\n    reputationImpact: number;\n    emotionalContext: {\n      mood: string;\n      intensity: number;\n    };\n  };\n  economicContext?: {\n    marketConditions: {\n      supply: number;\n      demand: number;\n    };\n    resourceValues: {\n      [key: string]: number;\n    };\n    tradeHistory?: {\n      success: number;\n      total: number;\n    };\n  };\n}\n```\n\n2. POI Evolution Event Payload:\n```typescript\n// From POIEvents.ts\n'poi:evolved': {\n  poiId: string;\n  poi: IPOI;\n  trigger: string;\n  changes: Partial<IPOI>;\n  version: number;\n}\n```\n\nEvent Flow Analysis:\n- The Interaction System triggers POI evolution through interactions that meet specific evolution rule conditions (e.g., high frequency of visits, specific interaction types).\n- The POI Evolution System emits 'poi:evolved' events through the EventBus.\n- These events are consumed by multiple systems including the Interaction System, NPC System, Economy System, War System, and Memory System.\n- All event payloads follow standardized TypeScript interfaces with type safety validation.\n\nI'm currently working on:\n1. Creating comprehensive sequence diagrams to visualize the event flow between systems\n2. Documenting all event triggers with their complete payload structures\n3. Mapping the full event propagation rules and dependencies\n4. Developing data validation and transformation specifications\n5. Analyzing potential performance bottlenecks for high-frequency event scenarios\n\nThe initial analysis shows that the event flow architecture is well-structured but may require optimization for high-volume interaction scenarios, particularly when multiple POIs evolve simultaneously.\n</info added on 2025-05-16T14:45:22.000Z>\n</info added on 2025-05-16T03:24:08.090Z>",

The POI System has well-defined RESTful endpoints including GET /pois for listing all POIs, GET /pois/:id for retrieving specific POI details, POST /pois for creating new POIs, PUT /pois/:id for updating existing POIs, DELETE /pois/:id for removing POIs, POST /pois/search for searching POIs based on criteria, GET /pois/nearby for location-based POI discovery, and GET /pois/categories for retrieving POI categorization information.\n\nWhile the Interaction System endpoints weren't explicitly documented in the codebase, I anticipate they follow similar CRUD patterns with endpoints like /interactions and /interactions/:id. Both systems adhere to RESTful conventions using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).\n\nThe API design patterns include TypeScript interfaces and JSON schemas for request/response data structures. Authentication is implemented using JWT tokens or API keys for protected endpoints. Rate limiting and versioning are managed at the API gateway or middleware level. Error responses follow standard HTTP status codes including 400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 422, 429, and 500. For event notifications, an EventBus system emits events such as 'poi:evolved' to facilitate integration between systems.\n\nMy next steps include drafting the complete OpenAPI/Swagger specification for all identified endpoints, documenting authentication mechanisms, rate limiting policies, and versioning strategies in detail, creating comprehensive documentation for webhook/event notification contracts, and reviewing the documentation with technical leads to ensure accuracy and completeness.\n\nThis documentation will build upon the data flow and event trigger specifications from subtask 472.2 and will provide essential input for the state management and error handling documentation planned for subtask 472.4.\n</info added on 2025-05-16T03:24:49.762Z>",

Priority rules have been established to handle scenarios where system-initiated changes may need to override user-initiated changes.\n\nTransaction boundaries are now clearly defined at event emission and consumption points, with compensating transactions implemented for rollback procedures when downstream systems fail to process events. Critical operations have documented consistency requirements to ensure data integrity across all systems.\n\nThe error handling framework has been standardized with consistent error codes and messages across all API responses and event payloads. HTTP status codes have been mapped to specific error scenarios, and there's a clear separation between user-facing error messages and system logging details.\n\nFor logging and monitoring, a structured JSON format with correlation IDs has been implemented to enable cross-system tracing and end-to-end traceability. Log levels have been defined based on operation types, with comprehensive examples provided for key integration scenarios.\n\nResilience patterns include retry policies with exponential backoff for transient errors, circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures, defined timeout values for cross-system calls, and documented fallback behaviors for scenarios where dependent systems are unavailable.\n\nThe team is now working on finalizing the documentation with sequence diagrams and decision trees, reviewing with technical leads, and developing test cases for error scenarios and state transitions.\n</info added on 2025-05-16T03:25:28.726Z>",
