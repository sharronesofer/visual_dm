# Interaction System Feature Prioritization Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all outstanding features for the Interaction System, categorized by priority, with references to source documentation (Tasks #478-480, #481), technical review, Q&A, and architectural decisions. The goal is to provide a clear, actionable roadmap for implementation and play-testing readiness.

## Critical Features (Blocking Play-Testing)
- **Core Interaction Detection and Processing**
  - Implement raycasting/collision-based detection for interactable objects
  - Develop `InteractionManager` to track interactables in player proximity
  - Input handling for triggering interactions
  - Base `Interactable` interface/class for all interactive objects
  - Reference: Task #481, Subtask 2; Technical Review (Task #480)

- **Interactable Object Types and Behaviors**
  - Concrete classes for each critical interactable (PickupItem, ActionableDevice, NPC, etc.)
  - Implement specific interaction behaviors and constraints (distance, required items, cooldowns)
  - Animation triggers and state changes for interactions
  - Reference: Task #481, Subtask 3; Expansion Plan (Task #478)

- **UI Feedback and Player Guidance**
  - Interaction prompts for nearby objects
  - Contextual options when multiple interactions are possible
  - Visual indicators for range/availability
  - Feedback for successful/failed/impossible interactions
  - Reference: Task #481, Subtask 4; UI/UX Review (Task #480)

- **Error Handling and Logging**
  - Robust error handling for all failure points
  - Logging system for interaction events and errors
  - Debug visualization for play-testing
  - Reference: Task #481, Subtask 5; Error Handling Patterns (Task #480)

- **Documentation and Technical Alignment**
  - Update technical documentation for all implemented features
  - Ensure alignment with architectural decisions (Task #480)
  - Reference: Task #481, Subtask 5; Architectural Decisions (Task #480)

## Important Features (Affecting Play-Testing Quality)
- **Advanced Interaction Types**
  - Support for multi-step or chained interactions
  - Conditional interactions based on player state or inventory
  - Reference: Expansion Possibilities (Task #478)

- **Expanded UI/UX**
  - Enhanced feedback for edge cases (e.g., overlapping interactables)
  - Accessibility options for interaction prompts
  - Reference: UI/UX Review (Task #480)

- **Performance Optimization**
  - Profiling and optimization for large numbers of interactables
  - Efficient event handling and memory management
  - Reference: Technical Review (Task #480)

- **Integration with Other Systems**
  - Ensure seamless communication with Dialogue, Memory, and POI Evolution systems
  - Reference: Integration Documentation (Task #472)

## Future Features (Post-Initial Testing)
- **Interaction Expansion**
  - New interaction types (e.g., environmental puzzles, group interactions)
  - Support for modding/custom interaction scripts
  - Reference: Expansion Plan (Task #478)

- **Analytics and Telemetry**
  - Collect and analyze player interaction data for balancing
  - Reference: Play-Testing Feedback (Task #481)

- **Polish and Visual Enhancements**
  - Finalize UI/UX for production
  - Add advanced visual/sound effects for interactions
  - Reference: UI/UX Review (Task #480)
