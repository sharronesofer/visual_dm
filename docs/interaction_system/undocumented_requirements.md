## Cross-Reference and Gap Analysis

All requirements have been cross-referenced with:
- Architectural decisions from Task #480 (see docs/interaction_poi_system_architecture.md)
- Feature implementation from Task #481 (see interaction_system_feature_prioritization_summary.md)

> No major gaps detected. All critical and important requirements are represented. Any future features or expansion items are noted as lower priority or for post-initial testing. Ongoing review is recommended as implementation progresses.

## Technical Debt and Out-of-Scope Items

- Support for modding/custom interaction scripts (planned for post-initial testing)
- Advanced analytics and telemetry for player interaction data (future feature)
- Final UI/UX polish and advanced visual/sound effects (production phase)
- Additional interaction types (e.g., environmental puzzles, group interactions)
- Ongoing review of integration with new or evolving systems (Dialogue, Memory, POI Evolution)

These items are acknowledged as important for long-term maintainability and feature growth but are not required for the current play-testing milestone. 

## Glossary

- **InteractionManager**: Core module responsible for detecting and managing interactable objects in proximity to the player.
- **EventBus**: System for emitting and subscribing to events across subsystems.
- **POI**: Point of Interest, a location or object in the game world with which players or NPCs can interact.
- **Edge Case**: Unusual or rare scenario that may affect system behavior or user experience.
