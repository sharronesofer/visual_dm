# AI Systems Documentation

## Overview
The AI Systems in Visual DM are responsible for all non-player character (NPC) behaviors, decision-making, and dynamic world responses. These systems leverage both rule-based logic and machine learning (including GPT-powered modules) to create emergent, believable, and context-aware behaviors across the game world.

## Key Components
- **Behavior Trees:** Used for structured, hierarchical NPC decision-making.
- **Utility AI:** Provides dynamic scoring for context-sensitive actions.
- **Dialogue Systems:** Integrate GPT and intent analysis for natural language conversations.
- **Pathfinding:** Uses A* and navigation mesh algorithms for movement and spatial reasoning.
- **Memory & Belief Systems:** NPCs track world events, player actions, and update their beliefs accordingly.
- **Motif & Goal Systems:** Drive long-term NPC and world objectives, supporting emergent narrative.

## Integration Points
- **Combat System:** AI selects actions, targets, and tactics based on combat context and NPC archetype.
- **Quest System:** AI generates, assigns, and tracks quest objectives for both NPCs and players.
- **Dialogue System:** Integrates with GPT modules for context-aware, dynamic conversations.
- **World Simulation:** AI influences and responds to world events, region changes, and player impact.
- **Networking:** Supports both local and server-authoritative AI for multiplayer scenarios.

## Best Practices
- **Separation of Concerns:** Keep AI logic modular (behavior, memory, dialogue, pathfinding, etc.).
- **Extensibility:** Use interfaces and data-driven design to allow new behaviors and goals to be added without code changes.
- **Performance:** Profile AI update loops, batch expensive operations, and use coroutines/async where possible.
- **Testing:** Implement unit and integration tests for all AI modules. Use simulation and scenario testing for emergent behaviors.
- **Fallbacks:** Always provide fallback behaviors for edge cases or failed GPT responses.
- **Documentation:** Document all AI modules, decision trees, and integration points. Include usage examples and extension guidelines.

## Testing & Validation
- **Unit Tests:** Cover all core AI modules (behavior trees, utility scoring, pathfinding, etc.).
- **Integration Tests:** Simulate full gameplay scenarios to validate AI decision-making and world interaction.
- **Performance Tests:** Profile AI under load (many NPCs, complex scenarios) and optimize as needed.
- **Regression Tests:** Ensure new AI features do not break existing behaviors or integrations.
- **Manual Playtesting:** Use playtest feedback to refine AI believability and challenge.
