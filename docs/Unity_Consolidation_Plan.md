# Unity Consolidation Plan: Duplicate Functionality and Asset Reorganization

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to consolidate duplicate functionality in the Unity backend and reorganize the asset directory structure for the Visual DM project. The goal is to establish a clear source of truth, eliminate circular dependencies, and simplify asset organization.

## 1. Duplicated Functionality Assessment

After analysis, the following duplicated functionality has been identified:

### GameLoader Class
- **Duplicates Found**: 
  - `/VDM/Assets/Scripts/GameLoader.cs`
  - `/VDM/Assets/Scripts/VisualDM/GameLoader.cs`
  - `/VDM/Assets/Scripts/VisualDM/Systems/GameLoader.cs`
  - `/VDM/Assets/Scripts/Core/GameLoader.cs`
  - `/VDM/Assets/Scripts/World/GameLoader.cs`

- **Authoritative Source**: `/VDM/Assets/Scripts/GameLoader.cs` (attached to Bootstrap.unity scene)
- **Status**: âœ… CONSOLIDATED - Created `/VDM/Assets/Scripts/Core/ConsolidatedGameLoader.cs`

### NetworkManager Class
- **Duplicates Found**: 
  - `/VDM/Assets/VisualDM/Network/Multiplayer/NetworkManager.cs` (Mirror.NetworkManager extension)
  - `/VDM/Assets/Scripts/VisualDM/Networking/NetworkManager.cs` (REST API client)

- **Assessment**: These are different managers with the same name but different functionality:
  - One is for Mirror multiplayer networking
  - The other is for REST API communications

- **Recommendation**: Rename for clarity
  - Rename `/VDM/Assets/Scripts/VisualDM/Networking/NetworkManager.cs` to `RestApiClient.cs`
- **Status**: âœ… RENAMED - Created `/VDM/Assets/Scripts/Networking/API/RestApiClient.cs`

### EventManager and EventDispatcher
- **Duplicates Found**:
  - `/VDM/Assets/VisualDM/Systems/EventManager.cs`
  - `/VDM/Assets/Scripts/VisualDM/Systems/EventManager.cs`
  - `/VDM/Assets/Scripts/Systems/Events/EventDispatcher.cs`
  - `/VDM/Assets/Scripts/VisualDM/Systems/EventDispatcher.cs`

- **Authoritative Source**: `/VDM/Assets/VisualDM/Systems/EventManager.cs` (most comprehensive implementation)
- **Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS - Move to `/VDM/Assets/Scripts/Systems/Events/EventManager.cs`

### StateManager
- **Duplicates Found**:
  - `/VDM/Assets/VisualDM/Systems/StateManager.cs`
  - `/VDM/Assets/Scripts/VisualDM/Systems/StateManager.cs`

- **Authoritative Source**: `/VDM/Assets/VisualDM/Systems/StateManager.cs`
- **Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS - Move to `/VDM/Assets/Scripts/Systems/State/StateManager.cs`

### TimeManager
- **Duplicates Found**:
  - `/VDM/Assets/VisualDM/Systems/TimeManager.cs`
  - Other implementations observed in code references

- **Authoritative Source**: `/VDM/Assets/VisualDM/Systems/TimeManager.cs`
- **Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS - Move to `/VDM/Assets/Scripts/Systems/Time/TimeManager.cs`

### PerformanceManager and PerformanceMonitor
- **Duplicates Found**:
  - `/VDM/Assets/Scripts/Systems/Performance/PerformanceManager.cs`
  - `/VDM/Assets/Scripts/Systems/Performance/PerformanceMonitor.cs`

- **Recommendation**: Keep both as they serve different purposes:
  - PerformanceManager: High-level performance management
  - PerformanceMonitor: Detailed performance monitoring
- **Status**: âœ… NO ACTION NEEDED - Keep in current location

### WebSocketClient
- **Duplicates Found**:
  - `/VDM/Assets/Scripts/Net/WebSocketClient.cs`
  - No direct duplicates in `VisualDM` directory

- **Authoritative Source**: `/VDM/Assets/Scripts/Net/WebSocketClient.cs`
- **Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS - Move to `/VDM/Assets/Scripts/Networking/API/WebSocketClient.cs`

## 2. Directory Restructuring Plan

The current structure has duplicated functionality across:
- `/VDM/Assets/Scripts/`
- `/VDM/Assets/Scripts/VisualDM/`
- `/VDM/Assets/VisualDM/`

### New Structure

```
/VDM/Assets/
â”œâ”€â”€ Scripts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Core/             # Core system functionality
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Networking/       # All networking components
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Multiplayer/  # Mirror multiplayer components
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ API/          # REST API and WebSocket components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Systems/          # Game systems
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Events/       # Event system
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ State/        # State management
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Time/         # Time management
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Performance/  # Performance monitoring
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ UI/               # UI components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Utils/            # Utility classes
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ World/            # World generation and management
â”œâ”€â”€ Resources/            # Game resources
â”œâ”€â”€ Prefabs/              # Prefabs
â”œâ”€â”€ Materials/            # Materials
â”œâ”€â”€ Textures/             # Textures
â””â”€â”€ Scenes/               # Scenes including Bootstrap.unity
```

**Status**: âœ… IMPLEMENTED - Scripts created to perform the reorganization

## 3. Consolidation Approach

### Phase 1: Prepare for Consolidation
1. âœ… Create a backup of the entire `/VDM/Assets/` directory
2. âœ… Document all references to each duplicated component
3. âœ… Create unit tests for key functionality before making changes

### Phase 2: Consolidate Core Systems
1. âœ… Consolidate GameLoader implementations
2. âœ… Rename the REST API NetworkManager to avoid confusion
3. ðŸ”„ Consolidate Event System components
4. ðŸ”„ Consolidate State Manager components
5. ðŸ”„ Consolidate Time Manager components

### Phase 3: Restructure Directories
1. âœ… Create the new directory structure
2. ðŸ”„ Move components to their appropriate locations
3. ðŸ”„ Update all references in scripts
4. ðŸ”„ Move assets from `/VDM/Assets/VisualDM/` to appropriate locations in the main Assets directory

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
1. ðŸ”„ Run all unit tests to ensure functionality remains intact
2. ðŸ”„ Manually test key features
3. ðŸ”„ Check for any broken references
4. ðŸ”„ Verify performance improvements

## 4. Dependency Management

### Current Issues
- Circular dependencies between modules
- Direct references to static instances
- Multiple entry points for the same functionality

### Solutions
1. âœ… Implement proper dependency injection
2. âœ… Use interfaces for system interactions

2. ðŸ”„ No duplicate code remains
3. ðŸ”„ Directory structure is clean and logical
4. ðŸ”„ All references are updated
5. âœ… Clear documentation exists for all systems
6. ðŸ”„ Performance has improved or remained the same

## 9. Consolidation Tools

The following tools have been created to assist with the consolidation process:

1. âœ… Unity Consolidation Helper (`scripts/unity_consolidation_helper.py`)
   - Analyzes codebase for duplicates, circular dependencies, and static references
   - Generates detailed reports

2. âœ… Unity Asset Reorganizer (`scripts/unity_asset_reorganizer.py`)
   - Reorganizes assets according to the consolidation plan
   - Updates script references

3. âœ… Bootstrap Scene Updater (`scripts/update_bootstrap_scene.py`)
   - Updates the Bootstrap.unity scene to reference consolidated components
