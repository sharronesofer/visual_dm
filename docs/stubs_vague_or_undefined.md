# Stubs: Vague or Undefined, Needs More Information

All previously listed vague or undefined stubs have now been addressed:

- The WorldEvent model is now fully implemented and documented, with tests.
- All 'pass' stubs in documentation have been replaced with TODO markers or real content.
- No stub classes/functions remain that are unreferenced or lack context.

**Status:** No unresolved vague or undefined stubs remain as of this update.
