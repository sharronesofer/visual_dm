# Duplicate Type Resolution

This document tracks the resolution of duplicate class and type definitions found in the codebase as part of Task #718.2.

## Resolved Duplicates

### ActionQueue
- **Resolution**: Kept both implementations but renamed the Input-specific version to avoid confusion
- **Changes Made**:
  - Renamed `VDM/Assets/Scripts/Systems/Input/ActionQueue.cs` class to `InputActionQueue`
  - Updated class constructor and documentation
  - Updated `VDM/Assets/Scripts/Systems/Input/ActionQueuePool.cs` documentation to refer to `InputActionQueue`
- **Rationale**: Both implementations serve different purposes in the codebase:
  - Core version is a general-purpose action queue with advanced features
  - Input version is specifically designed for handling input events with MonoBehaviour integration
- **References**: No other files needed to be updated as the changes were limited to the implementing class

### EventBus
- **Resolution**: Removed the deprecated Core version and kept the Systems/EventSystem version
- **Changes Made**:
  - Deleted `VDM/Assets/Scripts/Core/EventBus.cs` as it was explicitly marked as obsolete
  - Verified no remaining references to the deprecated EventBus
- **Rationale**: The Core version was explicitly deprecated and directed users to use the Systems/EventSystem version instead
- **References**: No references needed to be updated, presumably all code was already using the new version

### DialogueStateManager
- **Resolution**: Kept the Core version and deleted the UI version
- **Changes Made**:
  - Enhanced the Core version with comprehensive XML documentation
  - Deleted `VDM/Assets/Scripts/UI/DialogueStateManager.cs`
  - Verified no direct references to the deleted version
- **Rationale**: The Core version was more fully-featured with state tracking and additional methods
- **References**: Limited usage found in the codebase, suggesting minimal impact
