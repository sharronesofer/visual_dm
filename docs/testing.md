## Overview
This section describes the testing approach for the inventory management system, ensuring reliability, correctness, and maintainability.

## Test Coverage Summary
- **Unit Tests:** Cover all core classes (Repository, Container, Validator, Recovery, EventBus, QueryInterface, AttributeContainer)
- **Integration Tests:** Cover multi-component workflows, transaction rollback, and error recovery
- **Stress Tests:** Simulate high concurrency, large inventories, and edge cases
- **Event and Logging Tests:** Verify event emission, logging output, and integration hooks
- **Test Files:** See `app/inventory/test_inventory_container.py` and related test modules

## Testing Strategies

### Unit Testing
- Test each class and method in isolation
- Use pytest for test discovery and assertions
- Mock dependencies as needed

### Integration Testing
- Test workflows involving multiple components (e.g., add, transfer, backup, recover)
- Verify transactionality and rollback on error
- Use real or in-memory database for integration tests

### Stress and Concurrency Testing
- Simulate many concurrent operations (add, remove, transfer)
- Test for race conditions and data integrity under load
- Use pytest-xdist or similar tools for parallel execution

### Manual and Usability Testing
- Review logs and event output for clarity and completeness
- Attempt integration with external systems using only documentation
- Solicit feedback from developers and stakeholders

## Guidelines for Writing New Tests
- Place new tests in the appropriate test module (e.g., `test_inventory_container.py`)
- Use descriptive test names and docstrings
- Cover both success and failure cases
- Mock external dependencies for unit tests
- Use fixtures for setup/teardown
- Ensure tests are idempotent and do not depend on execution order
- Add tests for new features, bug fixes, and edge cases
