### General Principles
- Profile before optimizing; always measure first.
- Prefer async and non-blocking IO for backend services.
- Use object pooling and memory reuse for Unity runtime systems.
- Minimize allocations in hot paths (C# and Python).
- Use efficient serialization libraries (e.g., orjson for Python, custom binary for Unity if needed).
- Avoid reflection and dynamic code in performance-critical Unity code.
- Use batch operations for network and database access.
- Monitor and log performance metrics in production.
- Document all optimization changes and rationale.

### Unity (C#) Specific
- Use Unity's Profiler and custom metrics (InteractionMetricsCollector, MonitoringManager).
- Avoid frequent use of LINQ in update loops.
- Use structs for small, frequently created objects.
- Leverage Unity's Job System and Burst Compiler for parallelizable workloads.
- Use LRUCache and ObjectPool for memory management.
- Minimize use of Update() in favor of event-driven or batched processing.
- Profile garbage collection and minimize per-frame allocations.
- Use SpriteRenderer, not MeshRenderer, for 2D.
- All runtime, no UnityEditor or scene references.

### Python (FastAPI) Specific
- Use async def endpoints and database calls.
- Profile with cProfile, py-spy, or similar tools.
- Use Pydantic for data validation, orjson for fast JSON serialization.
- Batch database queries and use indexes.
- Use connection pooling for database and external APIs.
- Monitor memory usage and optimize data structures.
- Use FastAPI's dependency injection for resource management.
- Profile and optimize WebSocket endpoints for concurrency.

## 6. Backend Profiling Results (Initial)

- Profiling performed using cProfile on backend/fastapi_app.py.
- Output saved to backend/performance/backend_profile.out.
- Top bottlenecks and high-impact functions (to be updated as profiling is refined):
  - [Insert top functions and bottlenecks here after reviewing pstats output.]
- Next steps: Target these functions for async refactor, batching, or data structure optimization as appropriate.
- Continue profiling after each optimization to measure impact.

---

## 7. Unity (C#) Profiling and Metrics Plan

- Profiling will be performed using Unity Profiler and custom in-game metrics (InteractionMetricsCollector, MonitoringManager).
- Targeted systems for optimization:
  - Animation systems (AnimationJobSystem, AnimationMemorySystem, AnimationTimeline, etc.)
  - Input handling (ActionQueue, InputBuffer)
  - Event dispatching (EventBus, MonitoringManager)
  - Memory management (ObjectPool, LRUCache, MemoryUsageMonitor)
  - Gameplay systems (QuestManager, ArcManager, Motif systems, etc.)
- Key metrics to collect:
  - Frame time and frame rate stability
  - Per-system update time (ms)
  - Memory allocations per frame
  - Garbage collection frequency and duration
  - Input-to-action latency
  - Event dispatch and handling latency
- Results will be documented in this file and in additional reports as needed.
- Optimization changes will be implemented iteratively, with profiling after each change to measure impact.

---

## 8. Backend Monitoring Endpoints

- The backend now exposes the following monitoring endpoints:
  - `/health`: Liveness/readiness probe (JSON)
  - `/stats`: Current backend performance stats (JSON)
  - `/metrics`: Prometheus-compatible metrics for integration with Grafana/Prometheus
- Metrics collected include: request latency, memory usage, CPU usage, request count, error count, and more.
- See `backend/performance/monitoring_dashboard_spec.md` for full details on metrics and dashboard integration.
- Use these endpoints for real-time and historical performance analysis, and to guide ongoing optimization efforts.

---

## 9. Backend Historical Metrics Logging

- The backend now logs key performance metrics every 60 seconds to `backend/performance/metrics_history.csv`.
- Columns: timestamp, memory_mb, cpu_percent, request_count, error_count, throughput_rps.
- This enables retrospective analysis of performance trends, correlation with deployments/traffic, and data-driven optimization.
- The log file is automatically created and appended to by the monitoring background task.
- Use this data to identify regressions, spikes, or long-term trends in backend performance.

---

## 10. Unity Animation System Optimization

- The AnimationJobSystem now uses ObjectPool<AnimationTask> to pool and reuse AnimationTask objects.
- This minimizes per-frame allocations during animation job scheduling and execution.
- Expected impact: reduced garbage collection frequency, improved frame time stability, and lower memory usage during animation-heavy gameplay.
- All new/modified methods are documented with XML comments for maintainability.

---

## 11. Unity Input/Action System Optimization

- The ActionQueue now uses ActionQueuePool to pool and reuse QueuedAction structs.
- This minimizes per-frame allocations during input and action queuing, reducing GC pressure.
- Expected impact: lower garbage collection frequency, improved input-to-action latency, and more consistent frame times during input-heavy gameplay.
- All new/modified methods are documented with XML comments for maintainability.

---

## 12. Unity Event System and Monitoring Optimizations

- The EventBus (VisualDM.Systems.EventSystem.EventBus) is being profiled and optimized:
  - Object pooling for event argument objects to minimize per-frame allocations.
  - Batching of high-frequency event dispatches to reduce overhead.
  - Use of struct-based event args where possible for value-type efficiency.
  - Debug mode and weak reference cleanup to avoid memory leaks.
- The MonitoringManager is being enhanced to:
  - Track per-system update times (e.g., Animation, Input, Quest, etc.).
  - Log event dispatch and handling latency for key event types.
  - Expose metrics for garbage collection frequency and duration.
  - Ensure all metrics collection is allocation-free in hot paths.
- Expected impact: Lower GC pressure, improved frame time stability, and better visibility into runtime performance bottlenecks.
- Next steps: Implement and profile these optimizations, then document before/after metrics and lessons learned.

---

## 13. Unity Event System and Monitoring Implementation Update

- **EventBus**:
  - Implemented object pooling for event argument arrays using ArrayPool<object>.
  - Added batch dispatching for high-frequency events, configurable via SetBatching().

  - Optimize cross-system data models and enable binary serialization where appropriate.

---

## 17. Backend Serialization Model Audit and Optimization

- All Marshmallow (and Pydantic, where used) schemas for API serialization have been reviewed for unnecessary or redundant fields.
- Schemas such as `NPCSchema`, `QuestSchema`, and `ResourceSchema` were checked for:
  - Unused or redundant fields
  - Fields that can be made optional or omitted from responses
  - Opportunities to minimize payload size for network efficiency
- **Next Steps:**
  - Remove or make optional any fields not required by the client or UI.
  - For large or frequent payloads, implement binary serialization (e.g., `msgpack` for Python, custom binary for Unity).
  - Add versioning to data models to support future changes without breaking compatibility.
  - Profile serialization time for large payloads and optimize as needed.
- **Expected Impact:**
  - Smaller, faster API responses
