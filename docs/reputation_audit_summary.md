# Reputation System Integration Audit Summary

## Overview
This report summarizes the findings from the comprehensive audit of all reputation system integration points across the game codebase. The audit included static and dynamic analysis, documentation review, and the creation of a centralized event registry.

## Integration Points Needing Improvement or Formalization

### 1. Combat System Integration
- **Status:** Planned/documented, but not yet implemented in code.
- **Recommendation:** Implement event-based hooks for combat actions (kill, assist, attack neutral) to trigger reputation changes. Ensure these are logged via the audit logger.

### 2. Region System Support
- **Status:** Planned for future development.
- **Recommendation:** Define data structures and integration patterns for region-based reputation. Document and implement as new features are added.

### 3. Consistency in Logging and Error Handling
- **Status:** Most systems now call the audit logger, but some legacy or edge-case updates may not be covered.
- **Recommendation:** Review all reputation update code paths to ensure the logger is called consistently. Standardize error handling and logging formats.

### 4. Documentation Gaps
- **Status:** Some integration points (especially in the economy and group systems) lack detailed inline documentation.
- **Recommendation:** Add JSDoc comments and cross-references in code for all public reputation-related methods. Keep the API reference and technical specs up to date.

### 5. Event Registry Completeness
- **Status:** The event registry is comprehensive, but new events may be added as features evolve.
- **Recommendation:** Make updating the registry part of the development workflow for any new reputation-affecting feature.

## Recommendations for Standardization
- Use the ReputationAuditLogger for all reputation changes, regardless of system.
- Clamp all reputation values to defined min/max in a shared utility function.
- Document all new integration points in both the API reference and event registry.
- Use consistent naming conventions for reputation-related methods and events.
- Regularly review and update sequence diagrams and technical specs as the system evolves.

## Areas for Future Improvement
- Implement automated tests to verify that all reputation changes are logged.
- Develop a dashboard or visualization tool for real-time monitoring of reputation events during play-testing.
- Expand the audit process to cover edge cases and rare event chains.
