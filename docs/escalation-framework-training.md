## 1. Introduction
This guide provides comprehensive training for all team members on the alert escalation framework, including configuration, operation, and best practices for incident response.

## 2. System Architecture Overview
The escalation framework is designed to:
- Process alerts from multiple monitoring systems
- Categorize and escalate alerts based on severity and policy
- Notify appropriate personnel via multiple channels
- Track alert status and history
- Integrate with runbooks and dashboards

## 3. Configuration Files
### escalation_config.yaml
- Defines escalation paths, roles, timeframes, notification channels, system-specific overrides, auto-recovery, and suppression rules.
- Example: See `backend/core/monitoring/config/escalation_config.yaml`

### notification_templates.yaml
- Contains notification templates for all channels and severities.
- Example: See `backend/core/monitoring/config/notification_templates.yaml`

## 4. Python Components
- **AlertProcessor**: Orchestrates alert processing, suppression, auto-recovery, escalation, and notification.
- **EscalationManager**: Manages escalation logic, timeframes, and targets.
- **NotificationDispatcher**: Handles sending notifications to various channels.
- **Integration Adapters**: Normalize and ingest alerts from Prometheus, CloudWatch, Nagios, and other systems.

## 5. Alert Lifecycle Workflow
1. Alert received from monitoring system
2. Normalization by integration adapter
3. Processing by AlertProcessor
4. Suppression/auto-recovery checks
5. Initial notification and escalation path assignment
6. Periodic escalation checks and notifications
7. Resolution and postmortem

## 7. Role-Specific Guidance
### On-Call Engineers
- Respond to alerts, follow escalation procedures, use runbooks
- Acknowledge, resolve, or escalate alerts as appropriate

### SRE/DevOps
- Configure integrations, update escalation policies, troubleshoot issues
- Maintain configuration files and adapters

### Managers
- Review escalation reports, conduct incident postmortems
- Monitor system health and response metrics

### Cross-Functional Teams
- Understand alert priorities and response times
- Collaborate during major incidents

## 8. Quick Reference & Resources
- See `docs/escalation-quick-reference.md` for commands, escalation levels, and troubleshooting
- Pocket reference cards for on-call staff
