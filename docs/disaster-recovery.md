# Disaster Recovery Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the procedures for recovering the Visual DM system in case of a disaster or major outage.

## Recovery Objectives
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** 4 hours
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** 24 hours

## Backup Strategy
- Database: Daily full backups at 2 AM (see k8s/backup-cronjob.yaml)
- Media files: Continuous backup to S3 with versioning
- Configuration: Stored in Git repository and Kubernetes ConfigMaps/Secrets

## Recovery Procedures

### Database Recovery
1. Identify the most recent backup in S3
2. Restore the backup to a new database instance
3. Verify data integrity
4. Update application configuration to use the new database

### Application Recovery
1. Deploy the latest stable version from the container registry
2. Configure environment variables and secrets
3. Verify application health and connectivity

### Media Storage Recovery
1. Verify access to the backup storage (S3)
2. Restore media files if necessary
3. Update storage configuration if using a new endpoint

## Testing
- Disaster recovery procedures should be tested quarterly
- Document test results and update procedures as needed

- Store scripts in version control and update with every infra change
- Document dependencies and execution order in README or infra docs
