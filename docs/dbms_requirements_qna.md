## General Information

### What database system is used in this project?
PostgreSQL is used as the primary database management system for this project. We selected PostgreSQL due to its robust feature set, reliability, performance characteristics, and strong support for JSON/JSONB data types which are important for our game data storage needs.

### What version of PostgreSQL is required?
The project requires PostgreSQL 13 or higher. This is to ensure support for all features we use, particularly some of the newer JSON path operators and generated columns.

### Are there any specific PostgreSQL extensions required?
Yes, the following extensions are required:
- `uuid-ossp`: For UUID generation
- `pgcrypto`: For cryptographic functions and secure random UUID generation via `gen_random_uuid()`
- `btree_gin`: For GIN index support on B-tree indexable operations
- `pg_stat_statements`: For query performance monitoring

## Database Schema

### What are the main tables in the database?
The core tables in our schema include:
- `items`: Stores information about game items
- `rarity_tiers`: Defines rarity levels for items
- Additional tables will be added as the game development progresses

### What data types are used for storing game data?
We use a mix of data types:
- Standard types (VARCHAR, TEXT, INTEGER, DECIMAL, TIMESTAMP)
- PostgreSQL-specific types (UUID, JSONB)
- Custom ENUM types (item_type, item_rarity)

### How are relationships handled between entities?
Relationships are primarily handled using foreign keys with appropriate constraints and indexes. For example, the `items` table has a foreign key reference to the `rarity_tiers` table.

### Are there plans to expand the schema?
Yes, the schema will be expanded to include:
- Character data
- World generation data
- Quest and mission tracking
- Player progress and achievements
- Inventory management
- Combat and skill systems

## Performance Considerations

### What indexes are used to optimize performance?
We create indexes on commonly queried fields:
- Primary key indexes on ID fields
- Indexes on foreign key relationships
- Indexes on frequently filtered fields (name, type)
- Indexes on sorting fields (value)

### How are large JSON/JSONB objects handled?
Large JSON/JSONB objects are:
- Stored in dedicated columns (e.g., `base_stats`)
- Indexed using GIN indexes for efficient querying
- Accessed using JSON path expressions
- Validated for schema compliance before insertion

### What is the expected database size and growth rate?
The initial database size is expected to be relatively small (< 1GB), but will grow as:
- More players join the game
- More content is added
- Player-generated content accumulates

We anticipate 20-30% growth per month during the initial launch phase.

### Are there any query performance thresholds?
Yes, all queries should execute within the following timeframes:
- Read queries: < 100ms for 95th percentile
- Write operations: < 200ms for 95th percentile
- Aggregate queries: < 500ms for 95th percentile

Queries exceeding these thresholds should be reviewed and optimized.

## Data Migration and Versioning

### How are database migrations handled?
Migrations are:
1. Stored as numbered SQL files in the `src/db/migrations/` directory
2. Applied in sequential order
3. Tracked in a migrations metadata table
4. Executed using our custom migration tool

### What is the rollback strategy for failed migrations?
Each migration should include:
- Forward migration steps
- Rollback steps (when possible)
- Validation queries to verify success

The system attempts automatic rollback if a migration fails, and alerts the operations team.

### How is database versioning coordinated with application versioning?
Database versions are:
- Tagged with the corresponding application version
- Included in release notes
- Tested against both the current and previous application versions to ensure backward compatibility

## Connection Management

### How are database connections pooled?
We use a connection pooling strategy with:
- Minimum 5 connections in the pool
- Maximum 50 connections (configurable based on environment)
- 30-second connection timeout
- Connection health checks every 60 seconds

### What authentication method is used?
We use:
- Username/password authentication for development environments
- Certificate-based authentication for production
- Role-based access control with least privilege principles

### How are connection strings and credentials managed?
Connection parameters are:
- Stored as environment variables
- Never committed to version control
- Rotated periodically (every 90 days)
- Managed through a secure secrets management system

## Backup and Recovery

### What is the backup strategy?
The backup strategy includes:
- Daily full backups
- Hourly incremental backups
- Point-in-time recovery using WAL (Write-Ahead Log) files
- 30-day retention for daily backups
- 7-day retention for hourly backups

### What is the disaster recovery process?
The disaster recovery process includes:
1. Automated failure detection
2. Standby database activation (if applicable)
3. Backup restoration procedure
4. Data integrity verification
5. Application reconnection

Recovery Time Objective (RTO): 1 hour
Recovery Point Objective (RPO): 15 minutes

### How are backups verified?
Backups are verified by:
- Automated restoration tests to a separate environment
- Data integrity checks using checksums
- Sample query execution to validate functionality
- Monthly disaster recovery drills

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### What metrics are collected for database monitoring?
We collect:
- Query performance statistics
- Index usage and efficiency
- Connection counts and states
- Buffer cache hit ratios
- Disk I/O metrics
- WAL generation rate
- Table and index bloat

### How is database maintenance scheduled?
Regular maintenance includes:
- Weekly VACUUM ANALYZE during off-peak hours
- Monthly index rebuilds for fragmented indexes
- Quarterly storage reclamation
- Automated dead tuple cleanup

### What alerting thresholds are in place?
Alerts are triggered for:
- Query duration exceeding thresholds
- High CPU/memory utilization (>80% for 5 minutes)
- Low disk space (<20% remaining)
- Connection saturation (>80% of max connections)
- Replication lag (if applicable)
- Lock contention exceeding 30 seconds

## Security Considerations

### How is data encrypted?
Data encryption includes:
- TLS for all database connections
- Encryption at rest for production databases
- Column-level encryption for sensitive data
- Key rotation procedures for encryption keys

### What access controls are implemented?
Access controls include:
- Role-based access with principle of least privilege
- Regular permission audits
- Separation of duties between environments
- No direct access to production databases except for DBAs

### How are database security patches managed?
Security patches are:
- Evaluated within 24 hours of release
- Tested in development/staging environments
- Applied to production within the defined SLA (based on severity)
- Documented in the security compliance register

## Integration with Other Components

### How does the DBMS interact with the caching layer?
The database and cache interaction includes:
- Cache invalidation on data updates
- Write-through caching for critical data
- Time-based expiration for less critical data
- Cache warming procedures for high-demand data

### What ORM or database access layer is used?
We use:
- A custom data access layer built on top of node-postgres
- Query builders for complex queries
- Prepared statements for all database operations
- Connection pooling as described earlier

### How are database operations logged for debugging?
Database operations are logged with:
- Query parameters (excluding sensitive data)
- Execution time
- Affected row counts
- Error details (in case of failures)
- Correlation IDs to trace through the system

## Environment-Specific Configurations

### How does the database configuration differ between environments?
Environment-specific configurations:

| Configuration | Development | Staging | Production |
|---------------|-------------|---------|------------|
| Connection pool size | 5-10 | 10-20 | 20-50 |
| Query logging | Verbose | Errors only | Errors only |
| Performance schema | Enabled | Enabled | Selective |
| Automated backups | Daily | Hourly | Hourly + WAL |

## Future Enhancements

### Are there plans to implement sharding or partitioning?
We plan to implement table partitioning by:
- Date ranges for time-series data
- Geographic regions for location-based data
- Player IDs for user-specific data

This will be implemented in Phase 2 of the project.

### What high-availability configuration is planned?
The high-availability configuration will include:
- Primary-replica setup with automated failover
- Read replicas for distributing query load
