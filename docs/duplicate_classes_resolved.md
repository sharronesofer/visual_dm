# Duplicate Class Resolution Log

This document tracks the duplicate class definitions found in the codebase and their resolution as part of Task #718, Subtask 2.

## Detected Duplicate Classes

### 1. BountyHunterManager
- Found in `VDM/Assets/Scripts/Systems/BountyHunterManager.cs` (namespace: `VisualDM.Entities.BountyHunter`)
- Found in `VDM/Assets/Scripts/Systems/Bounty/BountyHunterManager.cs` (namespace: `VisualDM.Systems.Bounty`)

#### Resolution:
- Updated the first class to use proper namespace `VisualDM.Systems.Bounty` 
- Updated imports to use correct namespaces
- Deleted the second duplicate file, as the first was more complete with proper event handling
- Ensured all references point to the consolidated class

### 2. Validation Classes
Multiple validation classes were found across the codebase, many in directories that have been deleted during the cleanup:
- buildingValidation.py, ValidationService.py, equipmentValidation.py, poiValidation.py
- Similar utility classes across different directories

#### Resolution:
- These files were already deleted as part of the duplicate elimination
- The remaining validation logic is primarily in core2/validation/world_validation.py and inventory/inventory_utils.py
- No additional action needed as cleanup already addressed these duplicates

### 3. Inventory Classes
Multiple inventory-related classes were found, but upon inspection they represent different components of the inventory system in different contexts:
- InventorySystem.cs (Unity representation)
- Inventory models in backend/inventory/models/inventory.py
- DTO/request models in API endpoints

#### Resolution:
- These are not true duplicates as they serve different purposes in different parts of the architecture
- No merging needed, appropriate separation of concerns

## Remaining Considerations
- Core validation utilities should be audited to ensure consistent patterns are applied
- Backend model naming conventions should be standardized
- Unity class namespaces need continued cleanup to follow the VisualDM.[Module] pattern
