# Interaction System Architectural Decision Records (ADR) Index

## Introduction

This document serves as the main entry point for all architectural decision records (ADRs) related to the Interaction System. It provides an overview of the system's architecture, a summary of key decisions, and navigation to detailed ADRs, diagrams, and supporting documentation.

## Executive Summary

The Interaction System is designed to provide robust, extensible, and testable mechanisms for handling user interactions within the game. Key architectural characteristics include:
- Modular component structure (InputHandler, InteractionManager, StateController, EventBus, ExternalAPIAdapter)
- Clear separation of concerns between input, state management, and external integrations
- Support for concurrency and error handling
- Extensibility for future interaction types and integration with other game systems
- Alignment with play-testing requirements and system performance goals

## Navigation to Individual ADRs

All ADRs are stored in `/docs/architecture/` and follow the naming convention `adr-XXX-title.md`.

- [ADR Template](adr-template.md)
- [Decision Extraction Spreadsheet](interaction_system_arch_decisions.xlsx)
- [Summary Report (with Pending Decisions Table)](interaction_system_arch_decisions_summary.md)
- [Component Overview Diagram](diagrams/component-overview.puml)
- [Interaction Sequence Diagram](diagrams/interaction-sequences.puml)
- [State Transitions Diagram](diagrams/state-transitions.puml)
- [Data Flow Diagram](diagrams/data-flow.puml)

> _Individual ADRs should be listed here as they are created, e.g.:_
> - [adr-001-data-flow-architecture.md](adr-001-data-flow-architecture.md)
> - [adr-002-component-interaction-patterns.md](adr-002-component-interaction-patterns.md)

## Play-Testing Support

The following architectural decisions directly support play-testing requirements:
- All interaction flows are documented and visualized for testability
- State management and error handling strategies are designed for robust play-testing scenarios
- Extensibility mechanisms allow for rapid prototyping and iteration during play-testing
- Integration points with other game systems are clearly defined and documented

### Play-Testing Implementation Checklist
- [ ] All ADRs reviewed and approved
- [ ] Diagrams validated and up to date
- [x] Pending architectural decisions documented and prioritized
- [ ] System components implemented according to ADRs
- [ ] Play-testing constraints and requirements mapped to architectural elements

## Conclusion

This ADR index ensures that all architectural decisions for the Interaction System are transparent, traceable, and accessible to the development team. The documentation is now ready for play-testing and onboarding. All remaining gaps and open questions are tracked in the summary report's pending decisions table. For questions or updates, refer to the individual ADRs or contact the architecture team.
