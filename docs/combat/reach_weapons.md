# Reach Weapon Mechanics

## Overview
Reach weapons provide tactical advantages in combat by allowing attacks from a greater distance. Each type of reach weapon has unique characteristics and special abilities that encourage different combat strategies.

## Weapon Types

### Spear
- Attack Range: 2 hexes
- Base Damage Bonus: +20%
- Opportunity Attack Bonus: +50%
- Special: Effective at controlling space and punishing movement

### Pike
- Attack Range: 3 hexes
- Minimum Range: 2 hexes (cannot attack adjacent targets)
- Base Damage Bonus: +10%
- Special: Improved critical hit range
- Best used in formation to control large areas

### Halberd
- Attack Range: 2 hexes
- Armor Penetration: 20%
- Charge Attack Bonus: +30%
- Versatile weapon effective against armored opponents

### Whip
- Attack Range: 2 hexes
- Status Effect Chance: 20%
- Special Ability: Pull target 1 hex closer
- Excellent for battlefield control and positioning

## Combat Mechanics

### Range and Line of Sight
- Attacks must be within the weapon's range
- Clear line of sight is required for attacks
- Walls and obstacles block line of sight
- Distance is calculated using hex grid coordinates

### Threatened Hexes
- Each reach weapon threatens all hexes within its range
- Enemies moving through threatened hexes may trigger opportunity attacks
- Pike users cannot threaten adjacent hexes due to minimum range

### Special Attack Types

#### Opportunity Attacks
- Triggered when enemies move through threatened hexes
- Spears gain +50% damage on opportunity attacks
- Other reach weapons use normal damage calculations

#### Charge Attacks
- Halberds gain +30% damage when performing charge attacks
- Requires moving at least 2 hexes in a straight line before attacking

### Status Effects and Positioning
- Whips can apply status effects and reposition enemies
- Status effects vary based on combat situation
- Pull ability can be used tactically to break enemy formations

## Tactical Considerations

### Formation Fighting
- Pike users should maintain distance from enemies
- Spear users excel at supporting frontline fighters
- Halberd users can adapt to various combat roles
- Whip users should focus on disrupting enemy positioning

### Defensive Use
- Reach weapons help control space
- Can protect allies by threatening areas
- Consider terrain when positioning
- Use minimum range limitations tactically

### Offensive Strategies
- Combine with movement to maximize effectiveness
- Use terrain for tactical advantages
- Coordinate with allies for maximum effect
- Consider weapon-specific bonuses when choosing targets

## Integration with Other Systems

### Terrain Interaction
- Line of sight affected by terrain features
- Some terrain may provide cover or blocking
- Consider elevation effects on reach

### Status Effects
- Can be combined with weapon-specific effects
- May modify attack ranges or effectiveness
- Consider status effect resistance when using whips

### Movement and Positioning
- Plan movement accounting for threatened hexes
- Use reach advantages to control enemy movement
- Consider formation fighting and ally positions

## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Spear Users**
   - Position to maximize opportunity attack potential
   - Support frontline fighters
   - Control chokepoints

2. **Pike Users**
   - Maintain optimal distance
   - Form pike walls with allies
   - Watch for enemies closing distance

3. **Halberd Users**
   - Target armored opponents
   - Use charge attacks when possible
   - Adapt to combat situation

4. **Whip Users**
   - Disrupt enemy formations
   - Apply status effects strategically
   - Control enemy positioning

## Common Tactics

### Formation Fighting
```
Legend: S=Spear, P=Pike, H=Halberd, W=Whip, E=Enemy

Defensive Line:
S P P P S
 H H H H
  W W W

This formation provides:
- Pike control of distant hexes
- Spear protection of flanks
- Halberd support and charge potential
- Whip disruption from safety
```

### Zone Control
```
Legend: ■=Threatened Hex, P=Pike, S=Spear

Pike Control:
  ■ ■ ■
 ■ P ■
■ ■ ■ ■

Spear Control:
 ■ ■
■ S ■
 ■ ■
```

## Advanced Tips

1. **Combining Weapon Types**
   - Use pikes for distance control
   - Spears for immediate threat
   - Halberds for breakthrough
   - Whips for disruption

2. **Counter-Tactics**
   - Close quickly with pike users
   - Avoid threatened hexes when possible
   - Use terrain for cover
   - Coordinate movements with allies

3. **Formation Adaptation**
   - Adjust based on enemy composition
   - Account for terrain features
   - Maintain support positions
   - Plan for formation changes
