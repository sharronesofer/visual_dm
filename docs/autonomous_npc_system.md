# Autonomous NPC Lifecycle System Documentation

## Overview

The Autonomous NPC Lifecycle System transforms static NPCs into dynamic, living entities that evolve independently within your game world. This system manages everything from birth to death, including career progression, relationship formation, economic participation, and cultural evolution.

## Architecture

   - Central orchestrator for all autonomous behaviors
   - Handles lifecycle phase transitions
   - Manages goal generation and tracking
   - Coordinates relationship formation
   - Processes economic activities

2. **Database Models** (`autonomous_lifecycle_models.py`)
   - Comprehensive data models for NPC state tracking
   - Supports complex relationships and dependencies
   - Optimized for performance with proper indexing

3. **Performance Optimizer** (`performance_optimizer.py`)
   - Tier-based processing for scalability

## Performance Optimization

### Tier-Based Processing

The system uses a 4-tier architecture for scalable performance:

#### **Tier 1: Key Characters** (10-50 NPCs)
- **Processing**: Real-time, full simulation
- **Features**: Complete autonomy, detailed decision-making
- **Frequency**: Every game update cycle
- **Use Cases**: Important faction leaders, quest givers, player companions

#### **Tier 2: Notable NPCs** (50-200 NPCs)
- **Processing**: Hourly updates, high detail
- **Features**: Comprehensive lifecycle simulation
- **Frequency**: Hourly background processing
- **Use Cases**: Regional leaders, significant merchants, known personalities

#### **Tier 3: Regular Population** (200-1000 NPCs)
- **Processing**: Daily updates, moderate detail
- **Features**: Basic lifecycle and major events
- **Frequency**: Daily batch processing
- **Use Cases**: Regular townspeople, guards, common merchants

#### **Tier 4: Background Population** (1000+ NPCs)
- **Processing**: Statistical simulation only
- **Features**: Population-level trends and demographics
- **Frequency**: Weekly statistical updates
- **Use Cases**: Children, statistical population, crowd simulation

### Caching Strategy

- **Live Cache**: Tier 1 NPCs always in memory
- **Session Cache**: Tier 2 NPCs cached for 1 hour
- **Daily Cache**: Tier 3 NPCs cached for 24 hours
- **Statistical Cache**: Tier 4 aggregated data

### Parallel Processing

- **Thread Pool**: I/O-bound operations (database queries)
- **Process Pool**: CPU-bound operations (complex calculations)
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient bulk operations
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking lifecycle updates
