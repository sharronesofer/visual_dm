# Technical Overview

## Overview
This document provides a high-level technical overview of the Visual DM project, covering architecture, key systems, integration patterns, and best practices. It is intended for developers, maintainers, and integrators.

## Architecture
- **Frontend:** Unity 2D runtime, C# scripts, runtime-generated UI, no prefabs or scene references.
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI), modular service architecture, WebSocket and REST APIs.
- **Data Flow:** Event-driven, with clear separation between client, server, and data storage.
- **Persistence:** Uses both in-memory and persistent storage (files, databases) as appropriate.
- **Testing:** Comprehensive unit, integration, and performance testing across all systems.

## Key Systems
- **AI Systems:** NPC and world entity behaviors, GPT integration, decision-making.
- **Worldbuilding:** Region, faction, motif, and arc systems for dynamic world state.
- **Combat System:** Action response, chain actions, feedback, and performance monitoring.
- **Quest System:** Dynamic quest generation, tracking, and resolution.
- **Narrative System:** Motif, arc, and memory systems for emergent storytelling.
- **UI/UX:** Runtime-generated, accessible, and responsive user interface.

## Integration Patterns
- **Event Bus:** Decoupled communication between systems, both frontend and backend.
- **API Contracts:** Well-documented REST and WebSocket APIs for all major systems.
- **Data Models:** Shared schemas for entities, events, and world state.
- **Testing Hooks:** Integration points for automated and manual testing.

## Best Practices
- **Modularity:** Design systems as independent, testable modules.
- **Extensibility:** Use interfaces and data-driven design for future growth.
- **Performance:** Profile and optimize critical paths; batch operations where possible.
- **Documentation:** Maintain up-to-date docs for all systems and APIs.
- **Testing:** Ensure all systems are covered by unit, integration, and performance tests.

## Testing & Validation
- **Unit Tests:** Cover all key modules and integration points.
- **Integration Tests:** Simulate end-to-end flows across systems.
- **Performance Tests:** Profile under load and optimize as needed.
- **Manual Testing:** Use playtesting and QA feedback to refine systems.
