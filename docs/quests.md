# Quests Documentation

## Overview
The quest system in Visual DM provides dynamic, branching objectives for players and NPCs, driving narrative progression and world change. Quests are generated, tracked, and resolved using both rule-based and AI-driven logic, supporting emergent storytelling and replayability.

## Quest Types
- **Main Quests:** Core narrative arcs that drive world progression.
- **Side Quests:** Optional objectives for exploration, character development, or world-building.
- **Procedural Quests:** Dynamically generated based on world state, player actions, or NPC needs.
- **Faction Quests:** Linked to faction reputation, territory, and goals.
- **Event Quests:** Triggered by world events, region changes, or major NPC actions.

## State Management
- **Quest States:** Quests track progress through states (available, active, completed, failed, expired, hidden, etc.).
- **Versioning:** All quest data is versioned for rollback, migration, and debugging.
- **Progress Tracking:** Supports partial completion, multi-stage objectives, and branching outcomes.
- **Reward System:** Integrates with inventory, experience, and world state changes.

## Integration Points
- **AI Systems:** NPCs generate, assign, and track quests; AI influences quest outcomes and branching.
- **Worldbuilding:** Quests interact with regions, factions, and motifs for narrative depth.
- **Combat System:** Combat outcomes can resolve or branch quests.
- **Dialogue System:** GPT-powered conversations can trigger, update, or resolve quests.
- **UI/UX:** All quest data is surfaced through runtime-generated UI, with accessibility and feedback in mind.

## Best Practices
- **Branching & Replayability:** Design quests to support multiple outcomes and player choices.
- **Emergent Generation:** Use world state and AI to generate quests that feel organic and meaningful.
- **Documentation:** Document all quest types, state transitions, and integration points. Include usage examples and extension guidelines.
- **Testing:** Implement unit and integration tests for all quest logic and edge cases.

## Testing & Validation
- **Unit Tests:** Cover all quest modules (generation, tracking, resolution, etc.).
- **Integration Tests:** Simulate full quest flows, including branching and failure cases.
- **Performance Tests:** Profile quest generation and tracking under load.
- **Manual Playtesting:** Use playtest feedback to refine quest design and balance.
