# Alert Escalation Policy

This document defines the official escalation policies for all monitoring alerts in our system. It outlines responsibilities, timeframes, and actions required at each level of escalation to ensure timely and effective incident response.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Initial Responder
- First point of contact for all alerts
- Responsible for initial triage and acknowledgment
- Must follow alert-specific runbooks for initial investigation
- Determines if escalation is necessary

### Secondary Responder
- Subject matter expert for the specific system
- Takes over if initial responder cannot resolve the issue
- Has deeper system knowledge and troubleshooting capabilities
- May authorize temporary mitigation measures

### Incident Manager
- Coordinates response for P1/P2 incidents
- Manages communication across teams
- Decides on broader mitigation strategies
- Determines if management escalation is required

### Management Stakeholders
- Kept informed of P1 incidents and prolonged P2 incidents
- Provide business decisions when technical options have business impact
- Manage external communications when necessary
- Authorize emergency resource allocation

## Escalation Paths by Severity

### P1 (Critical) Alerts

- Alert escalated to Secondary On-Call Engineer
- Team Lead notified via messaging

**Second Escalation (2 hours without resolution):**
- Escalate to relevant System Owner(s)
- Incident Manager activated
- Cross-team experts consulted if needed

**Management Escalation (4 hours without resolution):**

- Status update required every 2 hours

### P3 (Medium) Alerts

**Initial Response:**
- Alert routed to Primary On-Call Engineer
- Acknowledgment required within 30 minutes
- Initial investigation must begin within 30 minutes

**First Escalation (1 hour without acknowledgment or 4 hours without resolution):**
- Alert escalated to Secondary On-Call Engineer
- Team Lead notified via messaging

**Second Escalation (8 hours without resolution):**
- Escalate to relevant System Owner(s)
- Include in daily status report

**Management Escalation (24 hours without resolution):**
- Director of Engineering notified if pattern emerges
- Include in weekly incident review

### P4 (Low) Alerts

**Initial Response:**
- Alert routed to Primary On-Call Engineer
- Acknowledgment required within 4 hours
- Initial investigation must begin within business day

**First Escalation (4 hours without acknowledgment or 1 business day without resolution):**
- Alert escalated to Secondary On-Call Engineer
- Added to team backlog

**Second Escalation (3 business days without resolution):**
- Escalate to Team Lead
- Prioritize in next sprint planning

## On-Call Schedule

- Primary and Secondary On-Call Engineers rotate weekly (Monday 9:00 AM to Monday 9:00 AM)
- Handoff procedure includes review of ongoing issues
- Schedule published one month in advance
- Holiday coverage planned two months in advance
- Emergency substitution process documented in the On-Call Playbook

## Escalation Procedures

### Acknowledgment Process
1. Receive alert notification via preferred channel (SMS, app, email)
2. Access alerting system and acknowledge the alert
3. Update incident status to "Investigating"
4. Join incident communication channel (Slack: #incident-response)

### Investigation Process
1. Follow alert-specific runbook from Alert Runbook Management System
2. Document initial findings in the incident ticket
3. Determine if additional expertise is needed
4. Update incident status every 30 minutes for P1/P2, 2 hours for P3/P4

### Escalation Process
1. If unable to resolve within the specified timeframe, initiate escalation
2. Contact next escalation level via specified channel
3. Provide concise summary of the issue and actions taken
4. Transfer ownership or collaborate as appropriate
5. Document escalation in the incident ticket

### Management Notification Process
1. Prepare concise executive summary
2. Include current status, business impact, estimated resolution time
3. Specify if decisions or resources are needed
4. Use template from the Communication Templates section

## Communication Templates

### Initial Response Template
```
[ALERT] [P1-P4]: [Alert Name]
Time detected: [Timestamp]
System affected: [System Name]
Current status: Investigating
Initial assessment: [Brief description]
Next update by: [Timestamp + appropriate interval]
```

### Escalation Template
```
[ESCALATION] [P1-P4]: [Alert Name]
Time of initial alert: [Timestamp]
Time of escalation: [Timestamp]
System affected: [System Name]
Current status: [Status]
Actions taken so far: [Summary of actions]
Reason for escalation: [Brief explanation]
Requested assistance: [Specific needs]
```

### Management Notification Template
```
[MANAGEMENT NOTIFICATION] [P1-P4]: [Alert Name]
Time of initial alert: [Timestamp]
Systems affected: [System Names]
Business impact: [Description of user/business impact]
Current status: [Status]
Actions in progress: [Summary of actions]
Estimated resolution: [Timestamp or timeframe]
Decisions needed: [If any]
```

## Cross-Team Escalation

For incidents requiring expertise from multiple teams:

1. Incident Manager to coordinate cross-team engagement
2. Use dedicated communication channel (#cross-team-incident)
3. Clear ownership of specific tasks must be established
4. Regular sync points every 30 minutes for P1, hourly for P2
5. Post-resolution review must include all teams involved

## Automated Escalation Rules

The alerting system will automatically escalate based on the following rules:

1. No acknowledgment within the specified timeframe
2. No status update for twice the update frequency
3. Incident explicitly marked for escalation
4. Related alerts triggering within the same system
5. Alert reoccurrence within 24 hours

## Integration with Incident Management

All P1 and P2 alerts automatically create incidents in the Incident Management System with:

1. Unique incident ID
2. Severity classification
3. Affected systems
4. Link to relevant runbooks
5. Automated timeline of events
6. Centralized communication channel

## Documentation and Continuous Improvement

All escalations will be documented with:

1. Timeline of events
2. Actions taken at each escalation level
3. Resolution path
4. Time to acknowledgment and resolution
5. Lessons learned

This documentation will be reviewed quarterly to identify:

1. Patterns in escalations
2. Opportunities to improve runbooks
3. Training needs
4. Adjustments to escalation timeframes
