# On-Call Engineer Training Module

## Overview
This module prepares on-call engineers to effectively respond to alerts, follow escalation procedures, and use available resources to resolve incidents quickly and accurately.

---

## 1. Responding to Alerts
- Monitor notification channels (Slack, Email, PagerDuty, SMS)
- Review alert details: severity, affected system, description, escalation level
- Use quick reference guide for immediate steps

## 2. Using Runbooks and Dashboards
- Access runbooks for step-by-step incident resolution ([Runbooks](https://runbooks.example.com/))
- Use dashboards to verify system status and metrics ([Dashboards](https://grafana.example.com/))
- Follow links provided in notifications for direct access

## 3. Acknowledging, Escalating, and Resolving Alerts
- Acknowledge alerts promptly to prevent unnecessary escalations
- Escalate alerts if unable to resolve within the defined timeframe
- Update alert status to 'resolved' with a clear resolution note
- Document actions taken in the alert history

## 4. Communication Protocols
- Communicate status updates to the team via designated channels
- Use escalation communication templates for consistent messaging
- Participate in incident calls or bridges as needed

## 5. Tips for Effective Incident Response
- Stay calm and follow documented procedures
- Prioritize based on alert severity and business impact
- Use available resources (runbooks, dashboards, team expertise)
- Escalate early if unsure or blocked
- Document all actions for post-incident review

## 6. Example Scenarios
- High CPU usage alert on production server (P2): Use runbook, acknowledge, resolve, document
- Database connectivity loss (P1): Escalate if not resolved within 10 minutes, join incident bridge, follow runbook
- Repeated non-critical alerts (P4): Check suppression rules, document findings

## 7. Best Practices
- Always acknowledge alerts you are working on
- Use runbooks for every incident, even if familiar
- Communicate clearly and frequently during incidents
- Review incident postmortems to improve future response
