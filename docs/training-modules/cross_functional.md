# Cross-Functional Team Training Module

## Overview
This module helps cross-functional teams (engineering, product, support, etc.) understand their role in the escalation framework and how to collaborate effectively during incidents.

---

## 1. Understanding Alert Priorities and Response Times
- Learn the severity levels (P1â€“P4) and what they mean for business impact
- Know expected response and resolution times for each severity
- Recognize which alerts require cross-team collaboration

## 2. Collaborating During Major Incidents
- Participate in incident calls or bridges as needed
- Provide expertise or support when requested by the incident commander or on-call engineer
- Share relevant information quickly and clearly

## 3. Communication Protocols and Escalation Awareness
- Use designated channels for incident communication (Slack, Email, etc.)
- Follow escalation notifications and be aware of your role in the process
- Escalate issues promptly if you identify new risks or blockers

## 4. Using Dashboards and Runbooks
- Access dashboards for real-time system status ([Dashboards](https://grafana.example.com/))
- Use runbooks for guidance on system behavior and troubleshooting ([Runbooks](https://runbooks.example.com/))
- Ask for clarification if unsure about alert meaning or next steps

## 5. Best Practices for Supporting Incident Response
- Stay available and responsive during major incidents
- Communicate proactively about dependencies or potential impacts
- Document any actions or findings relevant to the incident
- Participate in post-incident reviews to improve future response

## 6. Example Scenarios and Guidance
- High-severity alert affecting multiple teams: Join incident call, provide updates on your system
- Product issue traced to backend service: Collaborate with engineering to resolve, document findings
- Support team receives customer reports: Relay information to incident response team promptly
