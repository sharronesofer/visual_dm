# SRE/DevOps Training Module

## Overview
This module prepares SRE and DevOps team members to configure, maintain, and improve the alert escalation framework, ensuring reliability and rapid incident response.

---

## 1. Configuring Integrations
- Add or update integration adapters in `backend/core/monitoring/integrations/`
- Register new adapters in `integrations/__init__.py`
- Configure monitoring systems to forward alerts (webhook URLs, credentials, payload mapping)
- Validate integration with test alerts and logs

## 2. Updating Escalation Policies
- Edit `escalation_config.yaml` to adjust escalation paths, timeframes, roles, and notification channels
- Update `notification_templates.yaml` for new or modified notification formats
- Use version control for all configuration changes

## 3. Maintaining Configuration Files and Adapters
- Regularly review and update YAML files for accuracy and completeness
- Refactor adapters as monitoring systems evolve
- Document all changes and update training materials as needed

## 4. Troubleshooting Integration and Escalation Issues
- Use logs to diagnose integration failures and escalation errors
- Test configuration changes with simulated alerts
- Check for authentication, network, or payload format issues
- Use error handling and retry mechanisms in adapters

## 5. Validating Configuration Changes
- Trigger test alerts after any configuration update
- Verify correct alert processing, escalation, and notification delivery
- Use the test suite and hands-on exercises for validation

## 6. Best Practices
- Use modular, well-documented code for adapters
- Keep configuration files DRY and well-commented
- Monitor system health and alert volume for tuning
- Collaborate with on-call and management teams for feedback
- Continuously improve policies based on incident reviews

## 7. Example Scenarios
- Adding a new monitoring system integration (e.g., Datadog): Implement adapter, configure, test
- Adjusting escalation timeframes for a critical system: Edit YAML, validate with test alert
- Troubleshooting failed notifications: Check logs, review configuration, test with mock alert
