# Alert Escalation System Test Matrix

This document outlines the test scenarios for validating the alert escalation system.

## Test Scenarios

| Test ID | Category | Description | Expected Behavior | Test Method |
|---------|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| P1-01 | P1 Alert Handling | Critical database connection failure | Immediate notification to primary on-call, incident creation, automatic zoom bridge | `test_p1_critical_alert()` |
| P1-02 | P1 Alert Escalation | Unacknowledged P1 alert (15 min) | Escalation to secondary on-call, team lead, and incident manager | `test_p1_critical_alert()` with time simulation |
| P1-03 | P1 Alert Escalation | Unresolved P1 alert (45 min) | Second level escalation to service owner and director | Manual time simulation |
| P1-04 | P1 Alert Escalation | Unresolved P1 alert (75 min) | Management escalation to VP and CTO | Manual time simulation |
| P2-01 | P2 Alert Handling | High CPU usage on web server | Notification to primary on-call, incident creation | `test_p2_high_alert()` |
| P2-02 | P2 Alert Escalation | Unacknowledged P2 alert (30 min) | Escalation to secondary on-call and team lead | `test_p2_high_alert()` with time simulation |
| P2-03 | P2 Alert Escalation | Unresolved P2 alert (90 min) | Second level escalation to service owner and incident manager | Manual time simulation |
| P2-04 | P2 Alert Escalation | Unresolved P2 alert (210 min) | Management escalation to director | Manual time simulation |
| P3-01 | P3 Alert Handling | Medium API response time | Notification to primary on-call, ticket creation | `test_p3_medium_alert()` |
| P3-02 | P3 Alert Resolution | Resolved P3 alert | No escalation needed | `test_p3_medium_alert()` with resolution |
| P3-03 | P3 Alert Escalation | Unacknowledged P3 alert (60 min) | Escalation to secondary on-call | Manual time simulation |
| P4-01 | P4 Alert Handling | Low disk space warning | Notification to primary on-call, ticket creation | `test_p4_low_alert()` |
| SUP-01 | Alert Suppression | Alert during maintenance window | Alert is suppressed | `test_suppression_rule()` |
| REC-01 | Auto-Recovery | Service not responding | Automatic restart attempt | `test_auto_recovery()` |
| SYS-01 | System Override | Payment processing failures | Alert severity upgraded to P1 with payment-specific template | `test_system_override()` |
| NOT-01 | Notification | Verify all notification channels | Correct templates used for each channel | Manual verification in logs |
| NOT-02 | Notification | Verify escalation notification format | Proper escalation context and targets | Manual verification in output |

## Test Environment

The test environment should include:

1. Mock notification services (no actual external services called)
2. Complete configuration files with test-specific values
3. Time simulation for escalation testing
4. Output logging for verification

## Running Tests

Tests are executed using the `test_escalation_system.py` script which will:

1. Create mock alerts for each test scenario
2. Process them through the alert escalation system
3. Simulate time passing for escalation tests
4. Save test results to the `test_results` directory
5. Generate a test summary report

## Verification Points

For each test, the following should be verified:

1. Alert is processed correctly with proper severity
2. Appropriate initial notifications are sent
3. Escalation occurs at the correct time thresholds
4. Correct targets are notified during escalation
5. Templates are properly formatted for each notification channel
6. Alert history is correctly updated with actions taken

## Test Result Analysis

After running the tests, the output in the `test_results` directory should be analyzed to:

1. Verify all tests passed as expected
2. Check for any configuration issues
3. Validate the escalation paths for each severity level
4. Confirm proper template rendering
5. Ensure suppression rules and auto-recovery work correctly
