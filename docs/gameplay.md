# Gameplay Documentation

## Overview
The gameplay systems in Visual DM define the core player experience, including exploration, combat, questing, social interaction, and world progression. These systems are designed for emergent, replayable, and player-driven experiences, leveraging both deterministic and AI-driven mechanics.

## Core Gameplay Loops
- **Exploration:** Players navigate a procedurally generated world, discovering regions, POIs, and secrets.
- **Combat:** Turn-based and real-time combat systems, integrating action response, chain actions, and AI-driven opponents.
- **Questing:** Dynamic quest generation, tracking, and resolution, with branching outcomes and world impact.
- **Social Interaction:** Dialogue, reputation, and relationship systems, including GPT-powered NPC conversations.
- **Progression:** Character advancement, skill acquisition, and world state changes based on player actions.

## Systems Integration
- **AI Systems:** NPCs and world entities use AI for decision-making, dialogue, and emergent behaviors.
- **Worldbuilding:** Regions, factions, and motifs drive narrative and gameplay variety.
- **Combat System:** Integrates with action response, chain actions, and feedback systems for responsive gameplay.
- **Quest System:** Ties into world events, NPCs, and player actions for dynamic questlines.
- **UI/UX:** All gameplay systems are surfaced through runtime-generated UI, with accessibility and feedback in mind.

## Best Practices
- **Player Agency:** Design systems to maximize meaningful player choices and consequences.
- **Emergence:** Encourage systems to interact in ways that produce unexpected, interesting outcomes.
- **Balance:** Regularly test and tune systems for challenge, fairness, and replayability.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure all gameplay features are accessible to players with diverse needs.
- **Documentation:** Document all gameplay systems, loops, and integration points. Include usage examples and extension guidelines.

## Testing & Validation
- **Unit Tests:** Cover all core gameplay modules (combat, questing, progression, etc.).
- **Integration Tests:** Simulate full gameplay sessions to validate system interactions and edge cases.
- **Performance Tests:** Profile gameplay under load (many entities, complex scenarios) and optimize as needed.
- **Manual Playtesting:** Use playtest feedback to refine gameplay loops and balance.
