## Introduction

Visual DM is a tabletop roleplaying game companion/simulation tool that brings to life the worlds, characters, and stories from tabletop RPGs. It emphasizes a robust, modular, and extensible design with a focus on procedural generation, rich NPCs, and immersive storytelling driven by advanced AI.

The goal is to create a virtual world that facilitates an adaptive, living, and dynamic tabletop roleplaying experience. Visual DM allows for traditional GM-led play, solo/GM-less play, or a hybrid approach.

## Core Design Philosophy

1. **Accessibility with Depth:** Easy for beginners but with enough depth for experienced players.
2. **Modular Design:** Components that can be used independently or together.
3. **AI-Powered Storytelling:** AI that adapts to player choices and creates compelling narratives.
4. **Procedural Generation:** Dynamic content that feels handcrafted.
5. **Visual Storytelling:** Bringing game elements to life through maps, character portraits, and environments.
6. **Table-First Approach:** Enhancing the tabletop experience, not replacing it.
7. **System Flexibility:** Adaptable to different asset-sets and playstyles.
8. **Living Worlds:** Persistent worlds that evolve based on player actions.
9. **Chaos** Simulating chaos through the complex interplay of disparate systems

## Technical Framework

### Architecture Overview

The Visual DM architecture is built on a clean separation between business logic and infrastructure concerns, following a modular system design where each gameplay domain is encapsulated in its own system folder.

#### Backend Directory Structure

The backend follows a clean architectural pattern with clear separation of concerns:

#### Frontend Directory Structure (Unity)

The Unity frontend follows a clean architectural pattern that mirrors the backend structure and emphasizes separation of concerns:

```

#### Frontend System Internal Structure

Each system in the frontend follows a consistent four-layer pattern that mirrors backend organization:

```
/VDM/Assets/Scripts/Systems/[system_name]/
├── Models/            # Data models and DTOs for API communication
├── Services/          # HTTP/WebSocket communication services  
├── UI/                # User interface components and panels
├── Integration/       # Unity-specific integration logic
└── README.md          # System documentation and dependencies
```

**Layer Responsibilities:**

- **Models/**: Mirror backend DTOs exactly for API communication consistency
- **Services/**: Handle API communication, WebSocket updates, and business logic
- **UI/**: Provide user interaction through Unity UI components
- **Integration/**: Bridge Unity-specific requirements and game engine features

#### Frontend Communication Patterns

Frontend systems communicate through several patterns that ensure loose coupling:

1. **API Communication**: Direct communication with backend systems
   ```csharp
   // Service layer communicates with backend APIs
   var characters = await characterService.GetCharactersAsync();
   ```

2. **Event-Driven Updates**: Real-time updates via WebSocket
   ```csharp
   // WebSocket handlers update UI components
   regionWebSocket.OnRegionUpdated += UpdateRegionDisplay;
   ```

3. **Unity Event System**: UI and gameplay event communication
   ```csharp
   // Unity events for UI state changes
   UnityEvent<CharacterData> OnCharacterSelected;
   ```

4. **State Management**: Global state accessible across systems
   ```csharp
   // Centralized state management
   GameStateManager.Instance.SetCurrentCharacter(character);
   ```

#### Frontend Design Principles

- **Backend Alignment**: Frontend system structure mirrors backend systems exactly
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between data, logic, UI, and Unity integration
- **Consistent Patterns**: All systems follow the same four-layer structure
- **Unity Integration**: Unity-specific code isolated in Integration layer
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for responsive gameplay
- **Modular UI**: Reusable UI components with consistent theming
- **Performance First**: Efficient rendering and data management for smooth gameplay

#### System Communication Patterns

Systems communicate through several well-defined patterns:

1. **Direct Imports**: For tightly coupled systems within the same domain
   ```python
   from backend.systems.character.models import Character
   from backend.systems.faction.services import FactionService
   ```

2. **Infrastructure Utilities**: Shared infrastructure accessible to all systems
   ```python
   from backend.infrastructure.config import config
   from backend.infrastructure.utils import load_json, save_json
   from backend.infrastructure.database import get_db_session
   ```

3. **Event-Based Communication**: For loose coupling between systems
   ```python
   # Systems publish events without knowing their consumers
   await event_dispatcher.publish('faction.conflict_started', event_data)
   ```

4. **Shared Data Models**: Consistent state representation across systems
   ```python
   from backend.systems.shared.models import BaseEntity, TimeStamp
   ```

#### Design Principles

- **Clean Separation**: Business logic (`/systems/`) is completely separate from infrastructure concerns (`/infrastructure/`)
- **Canonical Organization**: All business logic resides within `/backend/systems/` with consistent internal structure
- **Infrastructure Abstraction**: Common utilities, configuration, and database access centralized in `/backend/infrastructure/`
- **Test Consistency**: Test structure in `/backend/tests/systems/` mirrors business logic structure exactly
- **Import Clarity**: Clear import patterns distinguish between business logic, infrastructure, and external dependencies

#### Infrastructure Components

The `/backend/infrastructure/` directory contains non-business-logic components:

- **Configuration Management**: Centralized application configuration and environment handling
- **Core Utilities**: JSON processing, error handling, logging, and common helper functions  
- **Database Infrastructure**: Session management, connection pooling, and database utilities
- **Validation Framework**: Rules engine and validation logic used across systems

This separation ensures that:
- Business logic systems focus purely on domain concerns
- Infrastructure changes don't impact business logic
- Systems can be easily tested in isolation
- New systems can be added without infrastructure dependencies

The architecture follows a layered approach:
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Database, configuration, shared utilities, validation
- **Business Logic Layer**: Domain-specific systems (character, combat, equipment, etc.)
- **Integration Layer**: Cross-system communication, event handling, API routing
- **Presentation Layer**: UI, external APIs, client interfaces

### Core Systems

**Improvement Notes:** Expand with code examples for key patterns.

#### Game Loop
The main execution cycle of the game manages the flow of gameplay, processing inputs, updating the game state, and rendering outputs at appropriate intervals.

#### Event System
The event system enables communication between loosely coupled components through a publish-subscribe pattern. Events are strongly typed and can be processed by middleware.

#### Asset Management
Handles loading, caching, and accessing game assets like images, audio, and data files.

#### Save/Load System
Manages game state persistence, allowing games to be saved and restored.

### Development Workflow

**Improvement Notes:** Add troubleshooting guide and common development tasks.

The development workflow for Visual DM emphasizes:

- Test-driven development for core systems
- Feature branching in version control
- Regular integration of changes
- Documentation updates alongside code changes
- Performance profiling for critical paths

Developers should follow these steps for new features:
1. Document design in appropriate section of Development Bible
2. Create tests for the new functionality in `/backend/tests/systems/`
3. Implement business logic in the appropriate `/backend/systems/` subdirectory
4. Use infrastructure components from `/backend/infrastructure/` as needed
5. Follow canonical import patterns for system communication
6. Update documentation with implementation details
7. Submit for review

#### Import Guidelines

**Business Logic Imports** (within systems):
```python
# Local system imports (preferred for internal modules)
from .models import MyModel
from .services import MyService

# Cross-system imports (for related business logic)
from backend.systems.character.models import Character
from backend.systems.faction.services import FactionService
```

**Infrastructure Imports** (from any system):
```python
# Infrastructure utilities
from backend.infrastructure.config import config
from backend.infrastructure.utils import load_json, save_json
from backend.infrastructure.database import get_db_session
from backend.infrastructure.validation.rules import validate_entity
```

**Shared Business Logic** (when needed):
```python
# Shared business components
from backend.systems.shared.models import BaseEntity
from backend.systems.shared.database import DatabaseMixin
```

## Systems

This section describes each of the core systems in Visual DM, aligned with the actual directory structure in the codebase.

### Canonical Directory Structure

**Reference:** The canonical system directory structure is defined in `/backend/tests/systems/` and must be mirrored in `/backend/systems/`.

The `/backend/tests/systems/` directory serves as the authoritative reference for system organization, containing 35+ defined system directories. Each system in `/backend/systems/` must correspond to a directory in the test structure to ensure consistent testing coverage and architectural alignment.

#### Business Logic Systems (`/backend/systems/`)

All game domain logic is organized under `/backend/systems/` with the following directories:

- `arc/` - Narrative arc management  
- `chaos/` - Chaos simulation and dynamic event systems
- `character/` - Character creation and management (includes relationship functionality)
- `combat/` - Combat mechanics and calculations
- `dialogue/` - Conversation and dialogue systems
- `diplomacy/` - Diplomatic relations and interactions
- `economy/` - Economic simulation and trading
- `espionage/` - Intelligence gathering and covert operations
- `equipment/` - Equipment and gear management
- `faction/` - Faction relationships and politics
- `game_time/` - Time management and scheduling
- `inventory/` - Item storage and management
- `loot/` - Loot generation and distribution
- `magic/` - Magic system and spells
- `memory/` - Game memory and state management
- `motif/` - Narrative motif tracking
- `npc/` - Non-player character management
- `poi/` - Points of interest
- `population/` - Population simulation
- `quest/` - Quest generation and tracking
- `region/` - Regional management and properties
- `repair/` - Equipment repair and maintenance system
- `religion/` - Religious systems and beliefs
- `rumor/` - Rumor propagation and tracking
- `tension/` - Conflict and tension mechanics
- `world_generation/` - Procedural world creation
- `world_state/` - Global world state management

**Note:** Game rules, balance constants, and JSON configurations have been moved to the new multi-tier `/data/` directory structure for better organization and access control.

#### Infrastructure Components (`/backend/infrastructure/`)

Non-business logic infrastructure is centralized under `/backend/infrastructure/`:

- `config/` - Configuration management and environment settings
- `utils/` - Core utilities (JSON processing, error handling, logging)
- `database/` - Database session management and connection utilities
- `validation/` - Rules engine and validation logic used across systems

#### Supporting Directories

- `/backend/tests/` - All test files organized by system, mirroring `/backend/systems/` structure
- `/backend/docs/` - Documentation, inventories, and architectural references
- `/backend/scripts/` - Development tools, maintenance scripts, and automation

#### System Internal Structure

Each system directory follows a consistent internal structure with both shared domain components and system-specific specializations:

```
/backend/systems/[system_name]/
├── models/           # System-specific specialized models and extensions
├── services/         # Business logic services  
├── repositories/     # Data access layer
├── routers/          # API endpoints and routing
├── events/           # System-specific events
├── utils/            # System-specific utilities
├── tests/            # Unit tests (integration tests in /backend/tests/)
└── __init__.py       # Module initialization
```

#### Shared Domain Components

In addition to individual system directories, the systems package includes shared domain components that are used across multiple systems:

```
/backend/systems/
├── models/           # ✅ SHARED CORE DOMAIN MODELS
│   ├── character.py  # Character, Skill (used by character, combat, faction, quest systems)
│   ├── npc.py        # NPC, PersonalityTrait (used by npc, dialogue, faction systems)
│   ├── item.py       # Item, ItemType, ItemRarity (used by inventory, equipment, repair, loot systems)
│   ├── faction.py    # Faction, FactionAlignment (used by faction, diplomacy, character systems)
│   ├── quest.py      # Quest, QuestStatus (used by quest, arc, character systems)
│   ├── location.py   # Location, LocationType (used by region, world, poi systems)
│   ├── world.py      # World, Season, WeatherCondition (used by world, time, region systems)
│   ├── market.py     # MarketItem, TradeOffer, Transaction (used by economy, repair systems)
│   └── __init__.py   # Exports all shared domain models
├── repositories/     # ✅ SHARED DOMAIN REPOSITORIES
│   ├── market_repository.py  # MarketRepository (used by economy, repair systems)
│   └── __init__.py   # Exports shared repositories
├── schemas/          # ✅ SHARED DOMAIN SCHEMAS
│   ├── world.py      # WorldData, Event (used by world, region systems)
│   └── __init__.py   # Exports shared schemas
├── rules/            # ✅ SHARED GAME RULES AND BALANCE
│   ├── rules.py      # Game balance constants, calculations, starting equipment
│   └── __init__.py   # Exports shared rules and constants
├── [individual_systems...]  # All 28+ individual game systems
└── __init__.py       # Package initialization with domain exports
```

**Note:** Game rules, balance constants, and configuration files have been moved to the new multi-tier `/data/` structure:
- **Public configurations** (builder/modder accessible): `/data/public/templates/`
- **System configurations** (internal): `/data/system/config/`
- **See `/data/README_MULTI_TIER_STRUCTURE.md` for complete organization details**

#### Hybrid Architecture Benefits

This hybrid approach provides the best of both architectural patterns:

**Shared Domain Models** for core game entities that span multiple systems:
- **Single Source of Truth**: Core entities like `Character`, `Item`, `Faction` defined once
- **Cross-System Consistency**: No model drift between systems
- **Import Clarity**: Clear ownership and simple imports for domain entities
- **DRY Principle**: No duplication of core domain concepts

**System-Specific Models** for specialized extensions and system-unique concepts:
- **Bounded Contexts**: Each system owns its specialized models
- **System Independence**: Systems can evolve specialized models independently  
- **Domain Extensions**: Systems extend core models with specialized relationships and properties

#### Import Patterns

**Shared Domain Models** (for core game entities):
```python
# ✅ Primary pattern for core domain entities
from backend.systems.models import Character, Item, Faction, Quest
from backend.systems.repositories import MarketRepository
```

**System-Specific Models** (for specialized extensions):
```python
# ✅ For system-specific specialized models
from backend.systems.character.models import Relationship, Mood, Goal
from backend.systems.combat.models import CombatAction, BattleState
from backend.systems.npc.models import ConversationState, AIPersonality
```

**Cross-System Services** (for business logic):
```python
# ✅ Cross-system business logic coordination
from backend.systems.character.services import CharacterService
from backend.systems.faction.services import FactionService
from backend.systems.quest.services import QuestService
```

**Infrastructure Components** (for cross-cutting concerns):
```python
# ✅ Infrastructure and utilities
from backend.infrastructure.config import config
from backend.infrastructure.utils import load_json
from backend.infrastructure.database import get_db_session
```

**Within Systems** (local imports):
```python
# ✅ Local imports within a system
from .models import SystemSpecificModel
from .services import SystemService
```

#### Architecture Rationale

This hybrid model is specifically designed for game development where:

1. **Core Domain Entities Are Cross-Cutting**: Game entities like characters, items, and factions are naturally used across multiple game systems
2. **Specialization Is System-Specific**: Systems need specialized models for their unique concerns (e.g., combat actions, conversation states)
3. **Consistency Is Critical**: Core game entities must remain consistent across all systems to prevent data integrity issues
4. **Performance Matters**: Single imports for core models reduce complexity and improve build times

This approach ensures that core domain models are shared and consistent while preserving system autonomy for specialized concerns.

### Arc System

**Status: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED**

**Location**: `/backend/systems/arc/` - Complete Arc System implementation including models, services, repositories, and API endpoints.

**Integration Test**: All components tested and working correctly via `backend/systems/arc/test_integration.py`

The Arc System provides a comprehensive meta-narrative framework that operates above individual quests and encounters, creating overarching storylines that give meaning and direction to player actions.

**Recent Major Update (2024):** Implemented Option B Tiered Access Approach for item identification, providing strategic depth while maintaining accessibility for different player types.

The loot system generates appropriate rewards for encounters, quests, and exploration. It balances randomness with appropriate progression and implements a strategic identification mechanic that scales with item rarity.

## Introduction

Visual DM is a tabletop roleplaying game companion/simulation tool that brings to life the worlds, characters, and stories from tabletop RPGs. It emphasizes a robust, modular, and extensible design with a focus on procedural generation, rich NPCs, and immersive storytelling driven by advanced AI.

The goal is to create a virtual world that facilitates an adaptive, living, and dynamic tabletop roleplaying experience. Visual DM allows for traditional GM-led play, solo/GM-less play, or a hybrid approach.

## Core Design Philosophy

1. **Accessibility with Depth:** Easy for beginners but with enough depth for experienced players.
2. **Modular Design:** Components that can be used independently or together.
3. **AI-Powered Storytelling:** AI that adapts to player choices and creates compelling narratives.
4. **Procedural Generation:** Dynamic content that feels handcrafted.
5. **Visual Storytelling:** Bringing game elements to life through maps, character portraits, and environments.
6. **Table-First Approach:** Enhancing the tabletop experience, not replacing it.
7. **System Flexibility:** Adaptable to different asset-sets and playstyles.
8. **Living Worlds:** Persistent worlds that evolve based on player actions.
9. **Chaos** Simulating chaos through the complex interplay of disparate systems

## Technical Framework

#### Frontend System Internal Structure

Each system in the frontend follows a consistent four-layer pattern that mirrors backend organization:

```
/VDM/Assets/Scripts/Systems/[system_name]/
├── Models/            # Data models and DTOs for API communication
├── Services/          # HTTP/WebSocket communication services  
├── UI/                # User interface components and panels
├── Integration/       # Unity-specific integration logic
└── README.md          # System documentation and dependencies
```

**Layer Responsibilities:**

- **Models/**: Mirror backend DTOs exactly for API communication consistency
- **Services/**: Handle API communication, WebSocket updates, and business logic
- **UI/**: Provide user interaction through Unity UI components
- **Integration/**: Bridge Unity-specific requirements and game engine features

#### Frontend Communication Patterns

Frontend systems communicate through several patterns that ensure loose coupling:

1. **API Communication**: Direct communication with backend systems
   ```csharp
   // Service layer communicates with backend APIs
   var characters = await characterService.GetCharactersAsync();
   ```

2. **Event-Driven Updates**: Real-time updates via WebSocket
   ```csharp
   // WebSocket handlers update UI components
   regionWebSocket.OnRegionUpdated += UpdateRegionDisplay;
   ```

3. **Unity Event System**: UI and gameplay event communication
   ```csharp
   // Unity events for UI state changes
   UnityEvent<CharacterData> OnCharacterSelected;
   ```

4. **State Management**: Global state accessible across systems

#### Frontend System Internal Structure

Each system in the frontend follows a consistent four-layer pattern that mirrors backend organization:

```
/VDM/Assets/Scripts/Systems/[system_name]/
├── Models/            # Data models and DTOs for API communication
├── Services/          # HTTP/WebSocket communication services  
├── UI/                # User interface components and panels
├── Integration/       # Unity-specific integration logic
└── README.md          # System documentation and dependencies
```

**Layer Responsibilities:**

- **Models/**: Mirror backend DTOs exactly for API communication consistency
- **Services/**: Handle API communication, WebSocket updates, and business logic
- **UI/**: Provide user interaction through Unity UI components
- **Integration/**: Bridge Unity-specific requirements and game engine features

#### Frontend Communication Patterns

Frontend systems communicate through several patterns that ensure loose coupling:

1. **API Communication**: Direct communication with backend systems
   ```csharp
   // Service layer communicates with backend APIs
   var characters = await characterService.GetCharactersAsync();
   ```

2. **Event-Driven Updates**: Real-time updates via WebSocket
   ```csharp
   // WebSocket handlers update UI components
   regionWebSocket.OnRegionUpdated += UpdateRegionDisplay;
   ```

3. **Unity Event System**: UI and gameplay event communication
   ```csharp
   // Unity events for UI state changes
   UnityEvent<CharacterData> OnCharacterSelected;
   ```

4. **State Management**: Global state accessible across systems
   ```csharp
   // Centralized state management
   GameStateManager.Instance.SetCurrentCharacter(character);
   ```

#### Frontend Design Principles

- **Backend Alignment**: Frontend system structure mirrors backend systems exactly
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between data, logic, UI, and Unity integration
- **Consistent Patterns**: All systems follow the same four-layer structure
- **Unity Integration**: Unity-specific code isolated in Integration layer
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for responsive gameplay
- **Modular UI**: Reusable UI components with consistent theming
- **Performance First**: Efficient rendering and data management for smooth gameplay

#### System Communication Patterns

Systems communicate through several well-defined patterns:

1. **Direct Imports**: For tightly coupled systems within the same domain
   ```python
   from backend.systems.character.models import Character
   from backend.systems.faction.services import FactionService
   ```

2. **Infrastructure Utilities**: Shared infrastructure accessible to all systems
   ```python
   from backend.infrastructure.config import config
   from backend.infrastructure.utils import load_json, save_json
   from backend.infrastructure.database import get_db_session
   ```

3. **Event-Based Communication**: For loose coupling between systems
   ```python
   # Systems publish events without knowing their consumers
   await event_dispatcher.publish('faction.conflict_started', event_data)
   ```

4. **Shared Data Models**: Consistent state representation across systems
   ```python
   from backend.systems.shared.models import BaseEntity, TimeStamp
   ```

#### Design Principles

- **Clean Separation**: Business logic (`/systems/`) is completely separate from infrastructure concerns (`/infrastructure/`)
- **Canonical Organization**: All business logic resides within `/backend/systems/` with consistent internal structure
- **Infrastructure Abstraction**: Common utilities, configuration, and database access centralized in `/backend/infrastructure/`
- **Test Consistency**: Test structure in `/backend/tests/systems/` mirrors business logic structure exactly
- **Import Clarity**: Clear import patterns distinguish between business logic, infrastructure, and external dependencies

#### Infrastructure Components

The `/backend/infrastructure/` directory contains non-business-logic components:

- **Configuration Management**: Centralized application configuration and environment handling
- **Core Utilities**: JSON processing, error handling, logging, and common helper functions  
- **Database Infrastructure**: Session management, connection pooling, and database utilities
- **Validation Framework**: Rules engine and validation logic used across systems

This separation ensures that:
- Business logic systems focus purely on domain concerns
- Infrastructure changes don't impact business logic
- Systems can be easily tested in isolation
- New systems can be added without infrastructure dependencies

The architecture follows a layered approach:
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Database, configuration, shared utilities, validation
- **Business Logic Layer**: Domain-specific systems (character, combat, equipment, etc.)
- **Integration Layer**: Cross-system communication, event handling, API routing
- **Presentation Layer**: UI, external APIs, client interfaces

### Core Systems

**Improvement Notes:** Expand with code examples for key patterns.

#### Game Loop
The main execution cycle of the game manages the flow of gameplay, processing inputs, updating the game state, and rendering outputs at appropriate intervals.

#### Event System
The event system enables communication between loosely coupled components through a publish-subscribe pattern. Events are strongly typed and can be processed by middleware.

#### Asset Management
Handles loading, caching, and accessing game assets like images, audio, and data files.

#### Save/Load System
Manages game state persistence, allowing games to be saved and restored.

### Development Workflow

**Improvement Notes:** Add troubleshooting guide and common development tasks.

The development workflow for Visual DM emphasizes:

- Test-driven development for core systems
- Feature branching in version control
- Regular integration of changes
- Documentation updates alongside code changes
- Performance profiling for critical paths

Developers should follow these steps for new features:
1. Document design in appropriate section of Development Bible
2. Create tests for the new functionality in `/backend/tests/systems/`
3. Implement business logic in the appropriate `/backend/systems/` subdirectory
4. Use infrastructure components from `/backend/infrastructure/` as needed
5. Follow canonical import patterns for system communication
6. Update documentation with implementation details
7. Submit for review

#### Import Guidelines

**Business Logic Imports** (within systems):
```python
# Local system imports (preferred for internal modules)
from .models import MyModel
from .services import MyService

# Cross-system imports (for related business logic)
from backend.systems.character.models import Character
from backend.systems.faction.services import FactionService
```

**Infrastructure Imports** (from any system):
```python
# Infrastructure utilities
from backend.infrastructure.config import config
from backend.infrastructure.utils import load_json, save_json
from backend.infrastructure.database import get_db_session
from backend.infrastructure.validation.rules import validate_entity
```

**Shared Business Logic** (when needed):
```python
# Shared business components
from backend.systems.shared.models import BaseEntity
from backend.systems.shared.database import DatabaseMixin
```

## Systems

This section describes each of the core systems in Visual DM, aligned with the actual directory structure in the codebase.

### Canonical Directory Structure

**Reference:** The canonical system directory structure is defined in `/backend/tests/systems/` and must be mirrored in `/backend/systems/`.

The `/backend/tests/systems/` directory serves as the authoritative reference for system organization, containing 35+ defined system directories. Each system in `/backend/systems/` must correspond to a directory in the test structure to ensure consistent testing coverage and architectural alignment.

#### Business Logic Systems (`/backend/systems/`)

All game domain logic is organized under `/backend/systems/` with the following directories:

- `arc/` - Narrative arc management  
- `chaos/` - Chaos simulation and dynamic event systems
- `character/` - Character creation and management (includes relationship functionality)
- `combat/` - Combat mechanics and calculations
- `dialogue/` - Conversation and dialogue systems
- `diplomacy/` - Diplomatic relations and interactions
- `economy/` - Economic simulation and trading
- `espionage/` - Intelligence gathering and covert operations
- `equipment/` - Equipment and gear management
- `faction/` - Faction relationships and politics
- `game_time/` - Time management and scheduling
- `inventory/` - Item storage and management
- `loot/` - Loot generation and distribution
- `magic/` - Magic system and spells
- `memory/` - Game memory and state management
- `motif/` - Narrative motif tracking
- `npc/` - Non-player character management
- `poi/` - Points of interest
- `population/` - Population simulation
- `quest/` - Quest generation and tracking
- `region/` - Regional management and properties
- `repair/` - Equipment repair and maintenance system
- `religion/` - Religious systems and beliefs
- `rumor/` - Rumor propagation and tracking
- `tension/` - Conflict and tension mechanics
- `world_generation/` - Procedural world creation
- `world_state/` - Global world state management

**Note:** Game rules, balance constants, and JSON configurations have been moved to the new multi-tier `/data/` directory structure for better organization and access control.

#### Infrastructure Components (`/backend/infrastructure/`)

Non-business logic infrastructure is centralized under `/backend/infrastructure/`:

- `config/` - Configuration management and environment settings
- `utils/` - Core utilities (JSON processing, error handling, logging)
- `database/` - Database session management and connection utilities
- `validation/` - Rules engine and validation logic used across systems

#### Supporting Directories

- `/backend/tests/` - All test files organized by system, mirroring `/backend/systems/` structure
- `/backend/docs/` - Documentation, inventories, and architectural references
- `/backend/scripts/` - Development tools, maintenance scripts, and automation

#### System Internal Structure

Each system directory follows a consistent internal structure with both shared domain components and system-specific specializations:

```
/backend/systems/[system_name]/
├── models/           # System-specific specialized models and extensions
├── services/         # Business logic services  
├── repositories/     # Data access layer
├── routers/          # API endpoints and routing
├── events/           # System-specific events
├── utils/            # System-specific utilities
├── tests/            # Unit tests (integration tests in /backend/tests/)
└── __init__.py       # Module initialization
```

#### Shared Domain Components

In addition to individual system directories, the systems package includes shared domain components that are used across multiple systems:

```
/backend/systems/
├── models/           # ✅ SHARED CORE DOMAIN MODELS
│   ├── character.py  # Character, Skill (used by character, combat, faction, quest systems)
│   ├── npc.py        # NPC, PersonalityTrait (used by npc, dialogue, faction systems)
│   ├── item.py       # Item, ItemType, ItemRarity (used by inventory, equipment, repair, loot systems)
│   ├── faction.py    # Faction, FactionAlignment (used by faction, diplomacy, character systems)
│   ├── quest.py      # Quest, QuestStatus (used by quest, arc, character systems)
│   ├── location.py   # Location, LocationType (used by region, world, poi systems)
│   ├── world.py      # World, Season, WeatherCondition (used by world, time, region systems)
│   ├── market.py     # MarketItem, TradeOffer, Transaction (used by economy, repair systems)
│   └── __init__.py   # Exports all shared domain models
├── repositories/     # ✅ SHARED DOMAIN REPOSITORIES
│   ├── market_repository.py  # MarketRepository (used by economy, repair systems)
│   └── __init__.py   # Exports shared repositories
├── schemas/          # ✅ SHARED DOMAIN SCHEMAS
│   ├── world.py      # WorldData, Event (used by world, region systems)
│   └── __init__.py   # Exports shared schemas
├── rules/            # ✅ SHARED GAME RULES AND BALANCE
│   ├── rules.py      # Game balance constants, calculations, starting equipment
│   └── __init__.py   # Exports shared rules and constants
├── [individual_systems...]  # All 28+ individual game systems
└── __init__.py       # Package initialization with domain exports
```

**Note:** Game rules, balance constants, and configuration files have been moved to the new multi-tier `/data/` structure:
- **Public configurations** (builder/modder accessible): `/data/public/templates/`
- **System configurations** (internal): `/data/system/config/`
- **See `/data/README_MULTI_TIER_STRUCTURE.md` for complete organization details**

#### Hybrid Architecture Benefits

This hybrid approach provides the best of both architectural patterns:

**Shared Domain Models** for core game entities that span multiple systems:
- **Single Source of Truth**: Core entities like `Character`, `Item`, `Faction` defined once
- **Cross-System Consistency**: No model drift between systems
- **Import Clarity**: Clear ownership and simple imports for domain entities
- **DRY Principle**: No duplication of core domain concepts

**System-Specific Models** for specialized extensions and system-unique concepts:
- **Bounded Contexts**: Each system owns its specialized models
- **System Independence**: Systems can evolve specialized models independently  
- **Domain Extensions**: Systems extend core models with specialized relationships and properties

#### Import Patterns

**Shared Domain Models** (for core game entities):
```python
# ✅ Primary pattern for core domain entities
from backend.systems.models import Character, Item, Faction, Quest
from backend.systems.repositories import MarketRepository
```

**System-Specific Models** (for specialized extensions):
```python
# ✅ For system-specific specialized models
from backend.systems.character.models import Relationship, Mood, Goal
from backend.systems.combat.models import CombatAction, BattleState
from backend.systems.npc.models import ConversationState, AIPersonality
```

**Cross-System Services** (for business logic):
```python
# ✅ Cross-system business logic coordination
from backend.systems.character.services import CharacterService
from backend.systems.faction.services import FactionService
from backend.systems.quest.services import QuestService
```

**Infrastructure Components** (for cross-cutting concerns):
```python
# ✅ Infrastructure and utilities
from backend.infrastructure.config import config
from backend.infrastructure.utils import load_json
from backend.infrastructure.database import get_db_session
```

**Within Systems** (local imports):
```python
# ✅ Local imports within a system
from .models import SystemSpecificModel
from .services import SystemService
```

#### Architecture Rationale

This hybrid model is specifically designed for game development where:

1. **Core Domain Entities Are Cross-Cutting**: Game entities like characters, items, and factions are naturally used across multiple game systems
2. **Specialization Is System-Specific**: Systems need specialized models for their unique concerns (e.g., combat actions, conversation states)
3. **Consistency Is Critical**: Core game entities must remain consistent across all systems to prevent data integrity issues
4. **Performance Matters**: Single imports for core models reduce complexity and improve build times

This approach ensures that core domain models are shared and consistent while preserving system autonomy for specialized concerns.

#### Frontend System Internal Structure

Each system in the frontend follows a consistent four-layer pattern that mirrors backend organization:

```
/VDM/Assets/Scripts/Systems/[system_name]/
├── Models/            # Data models and DTOs for API communication
├── Services/          # HTTP/WebSocket communication services  
├── UI/                # User interface components and panels
├── Integration/       # Unity-specific integration logic
└── README.md          # System documentation and dependencies
```

**Layer Responsibilities:**

- **Models/**: Mirror backend DTOs exactly for API communication consistency
- **Services/**: Handle API communication, WebSocket updates, and business logic
- **UI/**: Provide user interaction through Unity UI components
- **Integration/**: Bridge Unity-specific requirements and game engine features

#### Frontend Communication Patterns

Frontend systems communicate through several patterns that ensure loose coupling:

1. **API Communication**: Direct communication with backend systems
   ```csharp
   // Service layer communicates with backend APIs
   var characters = await characterService.GetCharactersAsync();
   ```

2. **Event-Driven Updates**: Real-time updates via WebSocket
   ```csharp
   // WebSocket handlers update UI components
   regionWebSocket.OnRegionUpdated += UpdateRegionDisplay;
   ```

3. **Unity Event System**: UI and gameplay event communication
   ```csharp
   // Unity events for UI state changes
   UnityEvent<CharacterData> OnCharacterSelected;
   ```

4. **State Management**: Global state accessible across systems

## Introduction

Visual DM is a tabletop roleplaying game companion/simulation tool that brings to life the worlds, characters, and stories from tabletop RPGs. It emphasizes a robust, modular, and extensible design with a focus on procedural generation, rich NPCs, and immersive storytelling driven by advanced AI.

The goal is to create a virtual world that facilitates an adaptive, living, and dynamic tabletop roleplaying experience. Visual DM allows for traditional GM-led play, solo/GM-less play, or a hybrid approach.

## Core Design Philosophy

1. **Accessibility with Depth:** Easy for beginners but with enough depth for experienced players.
2. **Modular Design:** Components that can be used independently or together.
3. **AI-Powered Storytelling:** AI that adapts to player choices and creates compelling narratives.
4. **Procedural Generation:** Dynamic content that feels handcrafted.
5. **Visual Storytelling:** Bringing game elements to life through maps, character portraits, and environments.
6. **Table-First Approach:** Enhancing the tabletop experience, not replacing it.
7. **System Flexibility:** Adaptable to different asset-sets and playstyles.
8. **Living Worlds:** Persistent worlds that evolve based on player actions.
9. **Chaos** Simulating chaos through the complex interplay of disparate systems

## Technical Framework

### Architecture Overview

The Visual DM architecture is built on a clean separation between business logic and infrastructure concerns, following a modular system design where each gameplay domain is encapsulated in its own system folder.

#### Backend Directory Structure

The backend follows a clean architectural pattern with clear separation of concerns:

#### Frontend System Internal Structure

Each system in the frontend follows a consistent four-layer pattern that mirrors backend organization:

```
/VDM/Assets/Scripts/Systems/[system_name]/
├── Models/            # Data models and DTOs for API communication
├── Services/          # HTTP/WebSocket communication services  
├── UI/                # User interface components and panels
├── Integration/       # Unity-specific integration logic
└── README.md          # System documentation and dependencies
```

**Layer Responsibilities:**

- **Models/**: Mirror backend DTOs exactly for API communication consistency
- **Services/**: Handle API communication, WebSocket updates, and business logic
- **UI/**: Provide user interaction through Unity UI components
- **Integration/**: Bridge Unity-specific requirements and game engine features

#### Frontend Communication Patterns

Frontend systems communicate through several patterns that ensure loose coupling:

1. **API Communication**: Direct communication with backend systems
   ```csharp
   // Service layer communicates with backend APIs
   var characters = await characterService.GetCharactersAsync();
   ```

2. **Event-Driven Updates**: Real-time updates via WebSocket
   ```csharp
   // WebSocket handlers update UI components
   regionWebSocket.OnRegionUpdated += UpdateRegionDisplay;
   ```

3. **Unity Event System**: UI and gameplay event communication
   ```csharp
   // Unity events for UI state changes
   UnityEvent<CharacterData> OnCharacterSelected;
   ```

4. **State Management**: Global state accessible across systems
   ```csharp
   // Centralized state management
   GameStateManager.Instance.SetCurrentCharacter(character);
   ```

#### Frontend Design Principles

- **Backend Alignment**: Frontend system structure mirrors backend systems exactly
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between data, logic, UI, and Unity integration
- **Consistent Patterns**: All systems follow the same four-layer structure
- **Unity Integration**: Unity-specific code isolated in Integration layer
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for responsive gameplay
- **Modular UI**: Reusable UI components with consistent theming
- **Performance First**: Efficient rendering and data management for smooth gameplay

#### System Communication Patterns

Systems communicate through several well-defined patterns:

1. **Direct Imports**: For tightly coupled systems within the same domain
   ```python
   from backend.systems.character.models import Character
   from backend.systems.faction.services import FactionService
   ```

2. **Infrastructure Utilities**: Shared infrastructure accessible to all systems
   ```python
   from backend.infrastructure.config import config
   from backend.infrastructure.utils import load_json, save_json
   from backend.infrastructure.database import get_db_session
   ```

3. **Event-Based Communication**: For loose coupling between systems
   ```python
   # Systems publish events without knowing their consumers
   await event_dispatcher.publish('faction.conflict_started', event_data)
   ```

4. **Shared Data Models**: Consistent state representation across systems
   ```python
   from backend.systems.shared.models import BaseEntity, TimeStamp
   ```

#### Design Principles

- **Clean Separation**: Business logic (`/systems/`) is completely separate from infrastructure concerns (`/infrastructure/`)
- **Canonical Organization**: All business logic resides within `/backend/systems/` with consistent internal structure
- **Infrastructure Abstraction**: Common utilities, configuration, and database access centralized in `/backend/infrastructure/`
- **Test Consistency**: Test structure in `/backend/tests/systems/` mirrors business logic structure exactly
- **Import Clarity**: Clear import patterns distinguish between business logic, infrastructure, and external dependencies

#### Infrastructure Components

The `/backend/infrastructure/` directory contains non-business-logic components:

- **Configuration Management**: Centralized application configuration and environment handling
- **Core Utilities**: JSON processing, error handling, logging, and common helper functions  
- **Database Infrastructure**: Session management, connection pooling, and database utilities
- **Validation Framework**: Rules engine and validation logic used across systems

This separation ensures that:
- Business logic systems focus purely on domain concerns
- Infrastructure changes don't impact business logic
- Systems can be easily tested in isolation
- New systems can be added without infrastructure dependencies

The architecture follows a layered approach:
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Database, configuration, shared utilities, validation
- **Business Logic Layer**: Domain-specific systems (character, combat, equipment, etc.)
- **Integration Layer**: Cross-system communication, event handling, API routing
- **Presentation Layer**: UI, external APIs, client interfaces

### Core Systems

**Improvement Notes:** Expand with code examples for key patterns.

#### Game Loop
The main execution cycle of the game manages the flow of gameplay, processing inputs, updating the game state, and rendering outputs at appropriate intervals.

#### Event System
The event system enables communication between loosely coupled components through a publish-subscribe pattern. Events are strongly typed and can be processed by middleware.

#### Asset Management
Handles loading, caching, and accessing game assets like images, audio, and data files.

#### Save/Load System
Manages game state persistence, allowing games to be saved and restored.

### Development Workflow

**Improvement Notes:** Add troubleshooting guide and common development tasks.

The development workflow for Visual DM emphasizes:

- Test-driven development for core systems
- Feature branching in version control
- Regular integration of changes
- Documentation updates alongside code changes
- Performance profiling for critical paths

Developers should follow these steps for new features:
1. Document design in appropriate section of Development Bible
2. Create tests for the new functionality in `/backend/tests/systems/`
3. Implement business logic in the appropriate `/backend/systems/` subdirectory
4. Use infrastructure components from `/backend/infrastructure/` as needed
5. Follow canonical import patterns for system communication
6. Update documentation with implementation details
7. Submit for review

#### Import Guidelines

**Business Logic Imports** (within systems):
```python
# Local system imports (preferred for internal modules)
from .models import MyModel
from .services import MyService

# Cross-system imports (for related business logic)
from backend.systems.character.models import Character
from backend.systems.faction.services import FactionService
```

**Infrastructure Imports** (from any system):
```python
# Infrastructure utilities
from backend.infrastructure.config import config
from backend.infrastructure.utils import load_json, save_json
from backend.infrastructure.database import get_db_session
from backend.infrastructure.validation.rules import validate_entity
```

**Shared Business Logic** (when needed):
```python
# Shared business components
from backend.systems.shared.models import BaseEntity
from backend.systems.shared.database import DatabaseMixin
```

## Systems

This section describes each of the core systems in Visual DM, aligned with the actual directory structure in the codebase.

### Canonical Directory Structure

**Reference:** The canonical system directory structure is defined in `/backend/tests/systems/` and must be mirrored in `/backend/systems/`.

The `/backend/tests/systems/` directory serves as the authoritative reference for system organization, containing 35+ defined system directories. Each system in `/backend/systems/` must correspond to a directory in the test structure to ensure consistent testing coverage and architectural alignment.

#### Business Logic Systems (`/backend/systems/`)

All game domain logic is organized under `/backend/systems/` with the following directories:

- `arc/` - Narrative arc management  
- `chaos/` - Chaos simulation and dynamic event systems
- `character/` - Character creation and management (includes relationship functionality)
- `combat/` - Combat mechanics and calculations
- `dialogue/` - Conversation and dialogue systems
- `diplomacy/` - Diplomatic relations and interactions
- `economy/` - Economic simulation and trading
- `espionage/` - Intelligence gathering and covert operations
- `equipment/` - Equipment and gear management
- `faction/` - Faction relationships and politics
- `game_time/` - Time management and scheduling
- `inventory/` - Item storage and management
- `loot/` - Loot generation and distribution
- `magic/` - Magic system and spells
- `memory/` - Game memory and state management
- `motif/` - Narrative motif tracking
- `npc/` - Non-player character management
- `poi/` - Points of interest
- `population/` - Population simulation
- `quest/` - Quest generation and tracking
- `region/` - Regional management and properties
- `repair/` - Equipment repair and maintenance system
- `religion/` - Religious systems and beliefs
- `rumor/` - Rumor propagation and tracking
- `tension/` - Conflict and tension mechanics
- `world_generation/` - Procedural world creation
- `world_state/` - Global world state management

**Note:** Game rules, balance constants, and JSON configurations have been moved to the new multi-tier `/data/` directory structure for better organization and access control.

#### Infrastructure Components (`/backend/infrastructure/`)

Non-business logic infrastructure is centralized under `/backend/infrastructure/`:

- `config/` - Configuration management and environment settings
- `utils/` - Core utilities (JSON processing, error handling, logging)
- `database/` - Database session management and connection utilities
- `validation/` - Rules engine and validation logic used across systems

#### Supporting Directories

- `/backend/tests/` - All test files organized by system, mirroring `/backend/systems/` structure
- `/backend/docs/` - Documentation, inventories, and architectural references
- `/backend/scripts/` - Development tools, maintenance scripts, and automation

#### System Internal Structure

Each system directory follows a consistent internal structure with both shared domain components and system-specific specializations:

```
/backend/systems/[system_name]/
├── models/           # System-specific specialized models and extensions
├── services/         # Business logic services  
├── repositories/     # Data access layer
├── routers/          # API endpoints and routing
├── events/           # System-specific events
├── utils/            # System-specific utilities
├── tests/            # Unit tests (integration tests in /backend/tests/)
└── __init__.py       # Module initialization
```

#### Shared Domain Components

In addition to individual system directories, the systems package includes shared domain components that are used across multiple systems:

```
/backend/systems/

**Note:** Game rules, balance constants, and configuration files have been moved to the new multi-tier `/data/` structure:
- **Public configurations** (builder/modder accessible): `/data/public/templates/`
- **System configurations** (internal): `/data/system/config/`
- **See `/data/README_MULTI_TIER_STRUCTURE.md` for complete organization details**

#### Hybrid Architecture Benefits

This hybrid approach provides the best of both architectural patterns:

**Shared Domain Models** for core game entities that span multiple systems:
- **Single Source of Truth**: Core entities like `Character`, `Item`, `Faction` defined once
- **Cross-System Consistency**: No model drift between systems
- **Import Clarity**: Clear ownership and simple imports for domain entities
- **DRY Principle**: No duplication of core domain concepts

**System-Specific Models** for specialized extensions and system-unique concepts:
- **Bounded Contexts**: Each system owns its specialized models
- **System Independence**: Systems can evolve specialized models independently  
- **Domain Extensions**: Systems extend core models with specialized relationships and properties

#### Import Patterns

**Shared Domain Models** (for core game entities):
```python
# ✅ Primary pattern for core domain entities
from backend.systems.models import Character, Item, Faction, Quest
from backend.systems.repositories import MarketRepository
```

**System-Specific Models** (for specialized extensions):
```python
# ✅ For system-specific specialized models
from backend.systems.character.models import Relationship, Mood, Goal
from backend.systems.combat.models import CombatAction, BattleState
from backend.systems.npc.models import ConversationState, AIPersonality
```

**Cross-System Services** (for business logic):
```python
# ✅ Cross-system business logic coordination
from backend.systems.character.services import CharacterService
from backend.systems.faction.services import FactionService
from backend.systems.quest.services import QuestService
```

**Infrastructure Components** (for cross-cutting concerns):
```python
# ✅ Infrastructure and utilities
from backend.infrastructure.config import config
from backend.infrastructure.utils import load_json
from backend.infrastructure.database import get_db_session
```

**Within Systems** (local imports):
```python
# ✅ Local imports within a system
from .models import SystemSpecificModel
from .services import SystemService
```

#### Architecture Rationale

This hybrid model is specifically designed for game development where:

1. **Core Domain Entities Are Cross-Cutting**: Game entities like characters, items, and factions are naturally used across multiple game systems
2. **Specialization Is System-Specific**: Systems need specialized models for their unique concerns (e.g., combat actions, conversation states)
3. **Consistency Is Critical**: Core game entities must remain consistent across all systems to prevent data integrity issues
4. **Performance Matters**: Single imports for core models reduce complexity and improve build times

This approach ensures that core domain models are shared and consistent while preserving system autonomy for specialized concerns.

- **Service Layer Improvements:** Placeholder code replaced with functional implementations
- **Configuration System Added:** JSON-driven configuration for easy customization

**✅ Implemented Alliance & Betrayal Mechanics:**
- Complete alliance lifecycle management (formation, maintenance, dissolution, betrayal)
- Trust degradation and reputation systems with configurable formulas
- Multi-faction alliance networks with cascade effects
- Betrayal probability calculations based on hidden attributes and external factors

**✅ JSON Configuration System:**
- **Alliance Configuration:** Customizable alliance types, betrayal factors, trust thresholds
- **Succession Configuration:** Leadership transition types, crisis triggers, outcome probabilities
- **Behavior Configuration:** Personality-driven behavior modifiers, decision weights, archetype templates
- **Configuration Loader:** Dynamic loading and reloading of JSON configurations without code changes

**✅ Modular Architecture Improvements:**
- Clear separation between domain logic (`/systems/faction/`) and infrastructure (`/infrastructure/`)
- Repository pattern for data persistence with proper SQLAlchemy entity management
- Service layer abstraction with dependency injection
- Event-driven architecture preparation for faction interactions

#### Current System Architecture:

**Core Subsystems:**
1. **Core Faction Management** - CRUD operations with hidden personality attributes
2. **Data Models & Persistence** - SQLAlchemy entities with infrastructure repository pattern
3. **Alliance & Diplomacy Engine** - Complex relationship management with JSON configuration
4. **Succession & Leadership** - Leadership transitions based on configurable governance types
5. **Membership Management** - Dynamic faction membership (placeholder implementation)
6. **Territory & Influence** - Territorial control and expansion (placeholder implementation)
7. **Reputation & Trust** - Multi-scale reputation tracking with configurable modifiers
8. **JSON Configuration System** - Non-developer customizable behavior parameters
9. **Utility & Validation** - Helper functions and data validation with config integration

**Business Logic Implementation:**
- **Faction Creation & Management:** Complete lifecycle with randomized or specified hidden attributes
- **Alliance Formation:** Multi-party alliance creation with compatibility analysis and configurable terms
- **Betrayal Mechanics:** Probability-based betrayal system with reason categorization and impact tracking
- **Succession Handling:** Crisis detection and resolution based on faction governance type
- **Configuration Management:** JSON-driven behavior modification allowing easy gameplay tuning
- **Hidden Attribute System:** Six personality dimensions affecting all faction behavior

#### Operational Status:

**✅ Working Endpoints:**
- `/factions/health` - System health check
- `/factions/generate-hidden-attributes` - Random personality generation
- `/factions/stats` - Basic system statistics (database queries temporarily disabled)

**⚠️ Temporarily Disabled:**
- Faction CRUD operations (database mapping conflicts)
- Succession and expansion routers (schema dependency issues)
- Advanced statistics (SQLAlchemy relationship mapping issues)

**🎯 Ready for Integration:**
- Alliance service logic (operational, awaiting database resolution)
- JSON configuration system (fully functional)
- Hidden attribute behavior modifiers (configurable via JSON)

#### Configuration Examples:

**Alliance Types (alliance_config.json):**
```json
{
  "military": {
    "trust_requirements": 60,
    "compatibility_factors": {
      "discipline_weight": 0.3,
      "integrity_weight": 0.4
    }
  }
}
```

**Behavior Modifiers (behavior_config.json):**
```json
{
  "expansion_tendency": {
    "formula": "(ambition * 0.4) + (discipline * 0.3) - (integrity * 0.2)"
  }
}
```

**Succession Types (succession_config.json):**
```json
{
  "hereditary": {
    "crisis_probability": 0.1,
    "stability_modifier": 1.2
  }
}
```

#### Integration Points & Dependencies:

**✅ Resolved Dependencies:**
- Infrastructure models for alliance/betrayal entities
- Configuration loader for behavior customization
- Service layer abstraction for business logic

**⏳ Pending Integration:**
- Database session management (SQLAlchemy mapping conflicts)
- Character system for faction membership
- Territory system for expansion mechanics
- Event system for autonomous faction behavior

#### Next Development Priorities:

1. **Database Integration Fix** - Resolve SQLAlchemy mapping conflicts affecting CRUD operations
2. **Autonomous Behavior Implementation** - Integrate JSON configurations with faction AI decision-making
3. **Territory Expansion System** - Connect faction ambition with territorial mechanics
4. **Character Integration** - Link character system with faction membership and reputation
5. **Event-Driven Simulation** - Implement faction autonomous evolution based on configured behavior

**🔧 Maintenance Status:** **SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED**
- 5 TODO items resolved through configuration system
- Circular import issues fixed
- Placeholder code replaced with functional implementations
- JSON configuration enables non-developer customization

The faction system now provides a robust, configurable foundation for complex political simulation with personality-driven faction behavior, alliance mechanics, and succession dynamics.

### Inventory System

**Summary:** Manages character inventories, item storage, weight calculations, and item categorization.

**Improvement Notes:** Add UI mockups for inventory interfaces.

The inventory system tracks items owned by characters, handling storage limitations, organization, and access. It manages encumbrance, categorization, and item interactions.

Key components include:
- Item storage and retrieval
- Weight and encumbrance calculation
- Item categorization and sorting
- Inventory UI
- Item transfers between inventories
- Special storage (bags of holding, etc.)

### Loot System

**Summary:** Generates treasure and rewards through drop tables with probabilistic distribution, level-appropriate scaling, and a sophisticated tiered item identification system.

**Recent Major Update (2024):** Implemented Option B Tiered Access Approach for item identification, providing strategic depth while maintaining accessibility for different player types.

The loot system generates appropriate rewards for encounters, quests, and exploration. It balances randomness with appropriate progression and implements a strategic identification mechanic that scales with item rarity.

#### Frontend System Internal Structure

Each system in the frontend follows a consistent four-layer pattern that mirrors backend organization:

```
/VDM/Assets/Scripts/Systems/[system_name]/
├── Models/            # Data models and DTOs for API communication
├── Services/          # HTTP/WebSocket communication services  
├── UI/                # User interface components and panels
├── Integration/       # Unity-specific integration logic
└── README.md          # System documentation and dependencies
```

**Layer Responsibilities:**

- **Models/**: Mirror backend DTOs exactly for API communication consistency
- **Services/**: Handle API communication, WebSocket updates, and business logic
- **UI/**: Provide user interaction through Unity UI components
- **Integration/**: Bridge Unity-specific requirements and game engine features

#### Frontend Communication Patterns

Frontend systems communicate through several patterns that ensure loose coupling:

1. **API Communication**: Direct communication with backend systems
   ```csharp
   // Service layer communicates with backend APIs
   var characters = await characterService.GetCharactersAsync();
   ```

2. **Event-Driven Updates**: Real-time updates via WebSocket
   ```csharp
   // WebSocket handlers update UI components
   regionWebSocket.OnRegionUpdated += UpdateRegionDisplay;
   ```

3. **Unity Event System**: UI and gameplay event communication
   ```csharp
   // Unity events for UI state changes
   UnityEvent<CharacterData> OnCharacterSelected;
   ```

4. **State Management**: Global state accessible across systems

#### Frontend Directory Structure (Unity)

The Unity frontend follows a clean architectural pattern that mirrors the backend structure and emphasizes separation of concerns:

```
/VDM/Assets/Scripts/

#### Frontend System Internal Structure

Each system in the frontend follows a consistent four-layer pattern that mirrors backend organization:

```
/VDM/Assets/Scripts/Systems/[system_name]/
├── Models/            # Data models and DTOs for API communication
├── Services/          # HTTP/WebSocket communication services  
├── UI/                # User interface components and panels
├── Integration/       # Unity-specific integration logic
└── README.md          # System documentation and dependencies
```

**Layer Responsibilities:**

- **Models/**: Mirror backend DTOs exactly for API communication consistency
- **Services/**: Handle API communication, WebSocket updates, and business logic
- **UI/**: Provide user interaction through Unity UI components
- **Integration/**: Bridge Unity-specific requirements and game engine features

#### Frontend Communication Patterns

Frontend systems communicate through several patterns that ensure loose coupling:

1. **API Communication**: Direct communication with backend systems
   ```csharp
   // Service layer communicates with backend APIs
   var characters = await characterService.GetCharactersAsync();
   ```

2. **Event-Driven Updates**: Real-time updates via WebSocket
   ```csharp
   // WebSocket handlers update UI components
   regionWebSocket.OnRegionUpdated += UpdateRegionDisplay;
   ```

3. **Unity Event System**: UI and gameplay event communication
   ```csharp
   // Unity events for UI state changes
   UnityEvent<CharacterData> OnCharacterSelected;
   ```

4. **State Management**: Global state accessible across systems
   ```csharp
   // Centralized state management
   GameStateManager.Instance.SetCurrentCharacter(character);
   ```

#### Frontend Design Principles

- **Backend Alignment**: Frontend system structure mirrors backend systems exactly
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between data, logic, UI, and Unity integration
- **Consistent Patterns**: All systems follow the same four-layer structure
- **Unity Integration**: Unity-specific code isolated in Integration layer
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for responsive gameplay
- **Modular UI**: Reusable UI components with consistent theming
- **Performance First**: Efficient rendering and data management for smooth gameplay

#### System Communication Patterns

Systems communicate through several well-defined patterns:

1. **Direct Imports**: For tightly coupled systems within the same domain
   ```python
   from backend.systems.character.models import Character
   from backend.systems.faction.services import FactionService
   ```

2. **Infrastructure Utilities**: Shared infrastructure accessible to all systems
   ```python
   from backend.infrastructure.config import config
   from backend.infrastructure.utils import load_json, save_json
   from backend.infrastructure.database import get_db_session
   ```

3. **Event-Based Communication**: For loose coupling between systems
   ```python
   # Systems publish events without knowing their consumers
   await event_dispatcher.publish('faction.conflict_started', event_data)
   ```

4. **Shared Data Models**: Consistent state representation across systems
   ```python
   from backend.systems.shared.models import BaseEntity, TimeStamp
   ```

#### Design Principles

- **Clean Separation**: Business logic (`/systems/`) is completely separate from infrastructure concerns (`/infrastructure/`)
- **Canonical Organization**: All business logic resides within `/backend/systems/` with consistent internal structure
- **Infrastructure Abstraction**: Common utilities, configuration, and database access centralized in `/backend/infrastructure/`
- **Test Consistency**: Test structure in `/backend/tests/systems/` mirrors business logic structure exactly
- **Import Clarity**: Clear import patterns distinguish between business logic, infrastructure, and external dependencies

#### Infrastructure Components

The `/backend/infrastructure/` directory contains non-business-logic components:

- **Configuration Management**: Centralized application configuration and environment handling
- **Core Utilities**: JSON processing, error handling, logging, and common helper functions  
- **Database Infrastructure**: Session management, connection pooling, and database utilities
- **Validation Framework**: Rules engine and validation logic used across systems

This separation ensures that:
- Business logic systems focus purely on domain concerns
- Infrastructure changes don't impact business logic
- Systems can be easily tested in isolation
- New systems can be added without infrastructure dependencies

The architecture follows a layered approach:
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Database, configuration, shared utilities, validation
- **Business Logic Layer**: Domain-specific systems (character, combat, equipment, etc.)
- **Integration Layer**: Cross-system communication, event handling, API routing
- **Presentation Layer**: UI, external APIs, client interfaces

### Core Systems

**Improvement Notes:** Expand with code examples for key patterns.

#### Game Loop
The main execution cycle of the game manages the flow of gameplay, processing inputs, updating the game state, and rendering outputs at appropriate intervals.

#### Event System
The event system enables communication between loosely coupled components through a publish-subscribe pattern. Events are strongly typed and can be processed by middleware.

#### Asset Management
Handles loading, caching, and accessing game assets like images, audio, and data files.

#### Save/Load System
Manages game state persistence, allowing games to be saved and restored.

### Development Workflow

**Improvement Notes:** Add troubleshooting guide and common development tasks.

The development workflow for Visual DM emphasizes:

- Test-driven development for core systems
- Feature branching in version control
- Regular integration of changes
- Documentation updates alongside code changes
- Performance profiling for critical paths

Developers should follow these steps for new features:
1. Document design in appropriate section of Development Bible
2. Create tests for the new functionality in `/backend/tests/systems/`
3. Implement business logic in the appropriate `/backend/systems/` subdirectory
4. Use infrastructure components from `/backend/infrastructure/` as needed
5. Follow canonical import patterns for system communication
6. Update documentation with implementation details
7. Submit for review

#### Import Guidelines

**Business Logic Imports** (within systems):
```python
# Local system imports (preferred for internal modules)
from .models import MyModel
from .services import MyService

# Cross-system imports (for related business logic)
from backend.systems.character.models import Character
from backend.systems.faction.services import FactionService
```

**Infrastructure Imports** (from any system):
```python
# Infrastructure utilities
from backend.infrastructure.config import config
from backend.infrastructure.utils import load_json, save_json
from backend.infrastructure.database import get_db_session
from backend.infrastructure.validation.rules import validate_entity
```

**Shared Business Logic** (when needed):
```python
# Shared business components
from backend.systems.shared.models import BaseEntity
from backend.systems.shared.database import DatabaseMixin
```

## Systems

This section describes each of the core systems in Visual DM, aligned with the actual directory structure in the codebase.

### Canonical Directory Structure

**Reference:** The canonical system directory structure is defined in `/backend/tests/systems/` and must be mirrored in `/backend/systems/`.

The `/backend/tests/systems/` directory serves as the authoritative reference for system organization, containing 35+ defined system directories. Each system in `/backend/systems/` must correspond to a directory in the test structure to ensure consistent testing coverage and architectural alignment.

#### Business Logic Systems (`/backend/systems/`)

All game domain logic is organized under `/backend/systems/` with the following directories:

- `arc/` - Narrative arc management  
- `chaos/` - Chaos simulation and dynamic event systems
- `character/` - Character creation and management (includes relationship functionality)
- `combat/` - Combat mechanics and calculations
- `dialogue/` - Conversation and dialogue systems
- `diplomacy/` - Diplomatic relations and interactions
- `economy/` - Economic simulation and trading
- `espionage/` - Intelligence gathering and covert operations
- `equipment/` - Equipment and gear management
- `faction/` - Faction relationships and politics
- `game_time/` - Time management and scheduling
- `inventory/` - Item storage and management
- `loot/` - Loot generation and distribution
- `magic/` - Magic system and spells
- `memory/` - Game memory and state management
- `motif/` - Narrative motif tracking
- `npc/` - Non-player character management
- `poi/` - Points of interest
- `population/` - Population simulation
- `quest/` - Quest generation and tracking
- `region/` - Regional management and properties
- `repair/` - Equipment repair and maintenance system
- `religion/` - Religious systems and beliefs
- `rumor/` - Rumor propagation and tracking
- `tension/` - Conflict and tension mechanics
- `world_generation/` - Procedural world creation
- `world_state/` - Global world state management

**Note:** Game rules, balance constants, and JSON configurations have been moved to the new multi-tier `/data/` directory structure for better organization and access control.

#### Infrastructure Components (`/backend/infrastructure/`)

Non-business logic infrastructure is centralized under `/backend/infrastructure/`:

- `config/` - Configuration management and environment settings
- `utils/` - Core utilities (JSON processing, error handling, logging)
- `database/` - Database session management and connection utilities
- `validation/` - Rules engine and validation logic used across systems

#### Supporting Directories

- `/backend/tests/` - All test files organized by system, mirroring `/backend/systems/` structure
- `/backend/docs/` - Documentation, inventories, and architectural references
- `/backend/scripts/` - Development tools, maintenance scripts, and automation

#### System Internal Structure

Each system directory follows a consistent internal structure with both shared domain components and system-specific specializations:

```
/backend/systems/[system_name]/
├── models/           # System-specific specialized models and extensions
├── services/         # Business logic services  
├── repositories/     # Data access layer
├── routers/          # API endpoints and routing
├── events/           # System-specific events
├── utils/            # System-specific utilities
├── tests/            # Unit tests (integration tests in /backend/tests/)
└── __init__.py       # Module initialization
```

#### Shared Domain Components

In addition to individual system directories, the systems package includes shared domain components that are used across multiple systems:

```
/backend/systems/
├── models/           # ✅ SHARED CORE DOMAIN MODELS
│   ├── character.py  # Character, Skill (used by character, combat, faction, quest systems)
│   ├── npc.py        # NPC, PersonalityTrait (used by npc, dialogue, faction systems)
│   ├── item.py       # Item, ItemType, ItemRarity (used by inventory, equipment, repair, loot systems)
│   ├── faction.py    # Faction, FactionAlignment (used by faction, diplomacy, character systems)
│   ├── quest.py      # Quest, QuestStatus (used by quest, arc, character systems)
│   ├── location.py   # Location, LocationType (used by region, world, poi systems)
│   ├── world.py      # World, Season, WeatherCondition (used by world, time, region systems)
│   ├── market.py     # MarketItem, TradeOffer, Transaction (used by economy, repair systems)
│   └── __init__.py   # Exports all shared domain models
├── repositories/     # ✅ SHARED DOMAIN REPOSITORIES
│   ├── market_repository.py  # MarketRepository (used by economy, repair systems)
│   └── __init__.py   # Exports shared repositories
├── schemas/          # ✅ SHARED DOMAIN SCHEMAS
│   ├── world.py      # WorldData, Event (used by world, region systems)
│   └── __init__.py   # Exports shared schemas
├── rules/            # ✅ SHARED GAME RULES AND BALANCE
│   ├── rules.py      # Game balance constants, calculations, starting equipment
│   └── __init__.py   # Exports shared rules and constants
├── [individual_systems...]  # All 28+ individual game systems
└── __init__.py       # Package initialization with domain exports
```

**Note:** Game rules, balance constants, and configuration files have been moved to the new multi-tier `/data/` structure:
- **Public configurations** (builder/modder accessible): `/data/public/templates/`
- **System configurations** (internal): `/data/system/config/`
- **See `/data/README_MULTI_TIER_STRUCTURE.md` for complete organization details**

#### Hybrid Architecture Benefits

This hybrid approach provides the best of both architectural patterns:

**Shared Domain Models** for core game entities that span multiple systems:
- **Single Source of Truth**: Core entities like `Character`, `Item`, `Faction` defined once
- **Cross-System Consistency**: No model drift between systems
- **Import Clarity**: Clear ownership and simple imports for domain entities
- **DRY Principle**: No duplication of core domain concepts

**System-Specific Models** for specialized extensions and system-unique concepts:
- **Bounded Contexts**: Each system owns its specialized models
- **System Independence**: Systems can evolve specialized models independently  
- **Domain Extensions**: Systems extend core models with specialized relationships and properties

#### Import Patterns

**Shared Domain Models** (for core game entities):
```python
# ✅ Primary pattern for core domain entities
from backend.systems.models import Character, Item, Faction, Quest
from backend.systems.repositories import MarketRepository
```

**System-Specific Models** (for specialized extensions):
```python
# ✅ For system-specific specialized models
from backend.systems.character.models import Relationship, Mood, Goal
from backend.systems.combat.models import CombatAction, BattleState
from backend.systems.npc.models import ConversationState, AIPersonality
```

**Cross-System Services** (for business logic):
```python
# ✅ Cross-system business logic coordination
from backend.systems.character.services import CharacterService
from backend.systems.faction.services import FactionService
from backend.systems.quest.services import QuestService
```

**Infrastructure Components** (for cross-cutting concerns):
```python
# ✅ Infrastructure and utilities
from backend.infrastructure.config import config
from backend.infrastructure.utils import load_json
from backend.infrastructure.database import get_db_session
```

**Within Systems** (local imports):
```python
# ✅ Local imports within a system
from .models import SystemSpecificModel
from .services import SystemService
```

#### Architecture Rationale

This hybrid model is specifically designed for game development where:

1. **Core Domain Entities Are Cross-Cutting**: Game entities like characters, items, and factions are naturally used across multiple game systems
2. **Specialization Is System-Specific**: Systems need specialized models for their unique concerns (e.g., combat actions, conversation states)
3. **Consistency Is Critical**: Core game entities must remain consistent across all systems to prevent data integrity issues
4. **Performance Matters**: Single imports for core models reduce complexity and improve build times

This approach ensures that core domain models are shared and consistent while preserving system autonomy for specialized concerns.

### Arc System

```

This AI framework enables autonomous diplomatic behavior that creates dynamic, realistic political landscapes without requiring constant player intervention, supporting the game's goal of living, evolving world simulation.

### Economy System

**Summary:** Simulates economic activities including currency, trade, markets, and resource management.

**Improvement Notes:** Add mathematical models for economic simulation.

**🔄 ONGOING SIMULATION UPGRADE REQUIRED:**

The Economy System must be upgraded to support autonomous economic simulation across all regions simultaneously. Markets should fluctuate based on real supply and demand from NPC activities, trade routes should evolve dynamically, and economic competition should occur naturally without player intervention.

**CURRENT LIMITATION:** Economic systems primarily respond to player actions rather than evolving autonomously.

**NEW REQUIREMENT:** Full world economic simulation with autonomous market forces, trade evolution, and economic competition between NPCs and regions.

#### Autonomous Economic Simulation Requirements:

1. **Real Supply/Demand Dynamics:** Prices fluctuate based on actual NPC production, consumption, and trading activities
2. **Dynamic Trade Route Evolution:** Trade routes change based on political stability, resource availability, and safety conditions
3. **Market Competition:** NPCs compete for market share, establish monopolies, and engage in economic warfare
4. **Regional Economic Specialization:** Regions develop economic advantages based on resources and geographic factors
5. **Economic Cycles:** Natural boom/bust cycles, seasonal variations, and economic crises occur autonomously
6. **Cross-Regional Economic Integration:** Regional economies influence each other through trade and resource dependencies
7. **Economic Innovation:** NPCs develop new trade relationships, discover markets, and create economic opportunities
8. **Wealth Accumulation/Loss:** NPCs and regions experience economic growth, decline, and recovery cycles

The economy system simulates a realistic economic environment affected by supply, demand, scarcity, and player actions.

#### Currency System

- **Standard Coins:** Gold, silver, and copper pieces. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** Currency values fluctuate based on regional economic conditions and trade relationships.
- **Regional Currencies:** Local variants with different values. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** Exchange rates change dynamically based on economic and political relationships.
- **Trade Goods:** Non-monetary items used for barter. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** Trade good values fluctuate based on regional availability and demand.
- **Precious Materials:** Gems and rare metals as alternative currencies. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** Values change based on discovery, depletion, and regional demand.

#### Economic Simulation

- **Supply and Demand:** Fluctuating prices based on availability. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** Real-time simulation of production, consumption, and stockpiles across all regions.
- **Regional Variations:** Different economies in different regions. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** Regions develop distinct economic characteristics and competitive advantages autonomously.
- **Event Impacts:** How events affect local and global economies. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** All world events (wars, disasters, discoveries) automatically impact relevant economic systems.
- **Player Influence:** How player actions can change economic conditions. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** Player impact becomes part of larger autonomous economic simulation.

#### Trade System

- **Merchant Networks:** Connected traders across regions. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** Merchant networks evolve, compete, and form alliances autonomously based on profitability and safety.
- **Caravan Routes:** Established trade paths with specific goods. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** Routes change dynamically based on political conditions, bandit activity, and economic opportunities.
- **Black Markets:** Illegal goods and services. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** Black markets emerge and evolve based on legal restrictions, enforcement levels, and demand.
- **Guild Influence:** How trade guilds affect prices and availability. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** Guilds compete for influence, establish territories, and engage in economic warfare.

#### Resource Management

- **Raw Materials:** Gathering and processing resources. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** Resource extraction occurs autonomously by NPCs based on demand, safety, and profitability.
- **Repair Materials:** Items used to maintain and repair equipment. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** Availability fluctuates based on raw material supply and repair demand across all regions.
- **Consumable Resources:** Items that are used up during gameplay. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** Production and consumption balanced autonomously across the world.
- **Rare Resources:** Valuable materials with special properties. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** Discovery, depletion, and control of rare resources drive autonomous conflicts and economic opportunities.

#### World-Scale Economic Simulation:

**[NEW REQUIREMENT]** Implement comprehensive autonomous economic systems:

1. **Production/Consumption Balance:** Each region produces and consumes goods based on population, resources, and capabilities
2. **Trade Network Optimization:** NPCs establish optimal trade routes and adapt to changing conditions
3. **Economic Warfare:** Factions use economic pressure, embargos, and market manipulation as strategic tools
4. **Resource Depletion/Discovery:** Mines empty, new resources are discovered, affecting global markets
5. **Technological/Knowledge Spread:** New repair techniques and economic innovations spread through trade networks
6. **Economic Migration:** NPCs relocate based on economic opportunities and regional economic health
7. **Market Manipulation:** Wealthy NPCs and factions attempt to manipulate markets for advantage
8. **Economic Espionage:** Information about resources, prices, and trade opportunities becomes valuable commodity

#### Frontend Directory Structure (Unity)

The Unity frontend follows a clean architectural pattern that mirrors the backend structure and emphasizes separation of concerns:

```
/VDM/Assets/Scripts/

#### Frontend System Internal Structure

Each system in the frontend follows a consistent four-layer pattern that mirrors backend organization:

```
/VDM/Assets/Scripts/Systems/[system_name]/
├── Models/            # Data models and DTOs for API communication
├── Services/          # HTTP/WebSocket communication services  
├── UI/                # User interface components and panels
├── Integration/       # Unity-specific integration logic
└── README.md          # System documentation and dependencies
```

**Layer Responsibilities:**

- **Models/**: Mirror backend DTOs exactly for API communication consistency
- **Services/**: Handle API communication, WebSocket updates, and business logic
- **UI/**: Provide user interaction through Unity UI components
- **Integration/**: Bridge Unity-specific requirements and game engine features

#### Frontend Communication Patterns

Frontend systems communicate through several patterns that ensure loose coupling:

1. **API Communication**: Direct communication with backend systems
   ```csharp
   // Service layer communicates with backend APIs
   var characters = await characterService.GetCharactersAsync();
   ```

2. **Event-Driven Updates**: Real-time updates via WebSocket
   ```csharp
   // WebSocket handlers update UI components
   regionWebSocket.OnRegionUpdated += UpdateRegionDisplay;
   ```

3. **Unity Event System**: UI and gameplay event communication
   ```csharp
   // Unity events for UI state changes
   UnityEvent<CharacterData> OnCharacterSelected;
   ```

4. **State Management**: Global state accessible across systems
   ```csharp
   // Centralized state management
   GameStateManager.Instance.SetCurrentCharacter(character);
   ```

#### Frontend Design Principles

- **Backend Alignment**: Frontend system structure mirrors backend systems exactly
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between data, logic, UI, and Unity integration
- **Consistent Patterns**: All systems follow the same four-layer structure
- **Unity Integration**: Unity-specific code isolated in Integration layer
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for responsive gameplay
- **Modular UI**: Reusable UI components with consistent theming
- **Performance First**: Efficient rendering and data management for smooth gameplay

#### System Communication Patterns

Systems communicate through several well-defined patterns:

1. **Direct Imports**: For tightly coupled systems within the same domain
   ```python
   from backend.systems.character.models import Character
   from backend.systems.faction.services import FactionService
   ```

2. **Infrastructure Utilities**: Shared infrastructure accessible to all systems
   ```python
   from backend.infrastructure.config import config
   from backend.infrastructure.utils import load_json, save_json
   from backend.infrastructure.database import get_db_session
   ```

3. **Event-Based Communication**: For loose coupling between systems
   ```python
   # Systems publish events without knowing their consumers
   await event_dispatcher.publish('faction.conflict_started', event_data)
   ```

4. **Shared Data Models**: Consistent state representation across systems
   ```python
   from backend.systems.shared.models import BaseEntity, TimeStamp
   ```

#### Design Principles

- **Clean Separation**: Business logic (`/systems/`) is completely separate from infrastructure concerns (`/infrastructure/`)
- **Canonical Organization**: All business logic resides within `/backend/systems/` with consistent internal structure
- **Infrastructure Abstraction**: Common utilities, configuration, and database access centralized in `/backend/infrastructure/`
- **Test Consistency**: Test structure in `/backend/tests/systems/` mirrors business logic structure exactly
- **Import Clarity**: Clear import patterns distinguish between business logic, infrastructure, and external dependencies

#### Infrastructure Components

The `/backend/infrastructure/` directory contains non-business-logic components:

- **Configuration Management**: Centralized application configuration and environment handling
- **Core Utilities**: JSON processing, error handling, logging, and common helper functions  
- **Database Infrastructure**: Session management, connection pooling, and database utilities
- **Validation Framework**: Rules engine and validation logic used across systems

This separation ensures that:
- Business logic systems focus purely on domain concerns
- Infrastructure changes don't impact business logic
- Systems can be easily tested in isolation
- New systems can be added without infrastructure dependencies

The architecture follows a layered approach:
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Database, configuration, shared utilities, validation
- **Business Logic Layer**: Domain-specific systems (character, combat, equipment, etc.)
- **Integration Layer**: Cross-system communication, event handling, API routing
- **Presentation Layer**: UI, external APIs, client interfaces

### Core Systems

**Improvement Notes:** Expand with code examples for key patterns.

#### Game Loop
The main execution cycle of the game manages the flow of gameplay, processing inputs, updating the game state, and rendering outputs at appropriate intervals.

#### Event System
The event system enables communication between loosely coupled components through a publish-subscribe pattern. Events are strongly typed and can be processed by middleware.

#### Asset Management
Handles loading, caching, and accessing game assets like images, audio, and data files.

#### Save/Load System
Manages game state persistence, allowing games to be saved and restored.

### Development Workflow

**Improvement Notes:** Add troubleshooting guide and common development tasks.

The development workflow for Visual DM emphasizes:

- Test-driven development for core systems
- Feature branching in version control
- Regular integration of changes
- Documentation updates alongside code changes
- Performance profiling for critical paths

Developers should follow these steps for new features:
1. Document design in appropriate section of Development Bible
2. Create tests for the new functionality in `/backend/tests/systems/`
3. Implement business logic in the appropriate `/backend/systems/` subdirectory
4. Use infrastructure components from `/backend/infrastructure/` as needed
5. Follow canonical import patterns for system communication
6. Update documentation with implementation details
7. Submit for review

#### Import Guidelines

**Business Logic Imports** (within systems):
```python
# Local system imports (preferred for internal modules)
from .models import MyModel
from .services import MyService

# Cross-system imports (for related business logic)
from backend.systems.character.models import Character
from backend.systems.faction.services import FactionService
```

**Infrastructure Imports** (from any system):
```python
# Infrastructure utilities
from backend.infrastructure.config import config
from backend.infrastructure.utils import load_json, save_json
from backend.infrastructure.database import get_db_session
from backend.infrastructure.validation.rules import validate_entity
```

**Shared Business Logic** (when needed):
```python
# Shared business components
from backend.systems.shared.models import BaseEntity
from backend.systems.shared.database import DatabaseMixin
```

## Systems

This section describes each of the core systems in Visual DM, aligned with the actual directory structure in the codebase.

### Canonical Directory Structure

**Reference:** The canonical system directory structure is defined in `/backend/tests/systems/` and must be mirrored in `/backend/systems/`.

The `/backend/tests/systems/` directory serves as the authoritative reference for system organization, containing 35+ defined system directories. Each system in `/backend/systems/` must correspond to a directory in the test structure to ensure consistent testing coverage and architectural alignment.

#### Business Logic Systems (`/backend/systems/`)

All game domain logic is organized under `/backend/systems/` with the following directories:

- `arc/` - Narrative arc management  
- `chaos/` - Chaos simulation and dynamic event systems
- `character/` - Character creation and management (includes relationship functionality)
- `combat/` - Combat mechanics and calculations
- `dialogue/` - Conversation and dialogue systems
- `diplomacy/` - Diplomatic relations and interactions
- `economy/` - Economic simulation and trading
- `espionage/` - Intelligence gathering and covert operations
- `equipment/` - Equipment and gear management
- `faction/` - Faction relationships and politics
- `game_time/` - Time management and scheduling
- `inventory/` - Item storage and management
- `loot/` - Loot generation and distribution
- `magic/` - Magic system and spells
- `memory/` - Game memory and state management
- `motif/` - Narrative motif tracking
- `npc/` - Non-player character management
- `poi/` - Points of interest
- `population/` - Population simulation
- `quest/` - Quest generation and tracking
- `region/` - Regional management and properties
- `repair/` - Equipment repair and maintenance system
- `religion/` - Religious systems and beliefs
- `rumor/` - Rumor propagation and tracking
- `tension/` - Conflict and tension mechanics
- `world_generation/` - Procedural world creation
- `world_state/` - Global world state management

**Note:** Game rules, balance constants, and JSON configurations have been moved to the new multi-tier `/data/` directory structure for better organization and access control.

#### Infrastructure Components (`/backend/infrastructure/`)

Non-business logic infrastructure is centralized under `/backend/infrastructure/`:

- `config/` - Configuration management and environment settings
- `utils/` - Core utilities (JSON processing, error handling, logging)
- `database/` - Database session management and connection utilities
- `validation/` - Rules engine and validation logic used across systems

#### Supporting Directories

- `/backend/tests/` - All test files organized by system, mirroring `/backend/systems/` structure
- `/backend/docs/` - Documentation, inventories, and architectural references
- `/backend/scripts/` - Development tools, maintenance scripts, and automation

#### System Internal Structure

Each system directory follows a consistent internal structure with both shared domain components and system-specific specializations:

```
/backend/systems/[system_name]/
├── models/           # System-specific specialized models and extensions
├── services/         # Business logic services  
├── repositories/     # Data access layer
├── routers/          # API endpoints and routing
├── events/           # System-specific events
├── utils/            # System-specific utilities
├── tests/            # Unit tests (integration tests in /backend/tests/)
└── __init__.py       # Module initialization
```

#### Shared Domain Components

In addition to individual system directories, the systems package includes shared domain components that are used across multiple systems:

```
/backend/systems/
├── models/           # ✅ SHARED CORE DOMAIN MODELS
│   ├── character.py  # Character, Skill (used by character, combat, faction, quest systems)
│   ├── npc.py        # NPC, PersonalityTrait (used by npc, dialogue, faction systems)
│   ├── item.py       # Item, ItemType, ItemRarity (used by inventory, equipment, repair, loot systems)
│   ├── faction.py    # Faction, FactionAlignment (used by faction, diplomacy, character systems)
│   ├── quest.py      # Quest, QuestStatus (used by quest, arc, character systems)
│   ├── location.py   # Location, LocationType (used by region, world, poi systems)
│   ├── world.py      # World, Season, WeatherCondition (used by world, time, region systems)
│   ├── market.py     # MarketItem, TradeOffer, Transaction (used by economy, repair systems)
│   └── __init__.py   # Exports all shared domain models
├── repositories/     # ✅ SHARED DOMAIN REPOSITORIES
│   ├── market_repository.py  # MarketRepository (used by economy, repair systems)
│   └── __init__.py   # Exports shared repositories
├── schemas/          # ✅ SHARED DOMAIN SCHEMAS
│   ├── world.py      # WorldData, Event (used by world, region systems)
│   └── __init__.py   # Exports shared schemas
├── rules/            # ✅ SHARED GAME RULES AND BALANCE
│   ├── rules.py      # Game balance constants, calculations, starting equipment
│   └── __init__.py   # Exports shared rules and constants
├── [individual_systems...]  # All 28+ individual game systems
└── __init__.py       # Package initialization with domain exports
```

**Note:** Game rules, balance constants, and configuration files have been moved to the new multi-tier `/data/` structure:
- **Public configurations** (builder/modder accessible): `/data/public/templates/`
- **System configurations** (internal): `/data/system/config/`
- **See `/data/README_MULTI_TIER_STRUCTURE.md` for complete organization details**

#### Hybrid Architecture Benefits

This hybrid approach provides the best of both architectural patterns:

**Shared Domain Models** for core game entities that span multiple systems:
- **Single Source of Truth**: Core entities like `Character`, `Item`, `Faction` defined once
- **Cross-System Consistency**: No model drift between systems
- **Import Clarity**: Clear ownership and simple imports for domain entities
- **DRY Principle**: No duplication of core domain concepts

**System-Specific Models** for specialized extensions and system-unique concepts:
- **Bounded Contexts**: Each system owns its specialized models
- **System Independence**: Systems can evolve specialized models independently  
- **Domain Extensions**: Systems extend core models with specialized relationships and properties

#### Import Patterns

**Shared Domain Models** (for core game entities):
```python
# ✅ Primary pattern for core domain entities
from backend.systems.models import Character, Item, Faction, Quest
from backend.systems.repositories import MarketRepository
```

**System-Specific Models** (for specialized extensions):
```python
# ✅ For system-specific specialized models
from backend.systems.character.models import Relationship, Mood, Goal
from backend.systems.combat.models import CombatAction, BattleState
from backend.systems.npc.models import ConversationState, AIPersonality
```

**Cross-System Services** (for business logic):
```python
# ✅ Cross-system business logic coordination
from backend.systems.character.services import CharacterService
from backend.systems.faction.services import FactionService
from backend.systems.quest.services import QuestService
```

**Infrastructure Components** (for cross-cutting concerns):
```python
# ✅ Infrastructure and utilities
from backend.infrastructure.config import config
from backend.infrastructure.utils import load_json
from backend.infrastructure.database import get_db_session
```

**Within Systems** (local imports):
```python
# ✅ Local imports within a system
from .models import SystemSpecificModel
from .services import SystemService
```

#### Architecture Rationale

This hybrid model is specifically designed for game development where:

1. **Core Domain Entities Are Cross-Cutting**: Game entities like characters, items, and factions are naturally used across multiple game systems
2. **Specialization Is System-Specific**: Systems need specialized models for their unique concerns (e.g., combat actions, conversation states)
3. **Consistency Is Critical**: Core game entities must remain consistent across all systems to prevent data integrity issues
4. **Performance Matters**: Single imports for core models reduce complexity and improve build times

This approach ensures that core domain models are shared and consistent while preserving system autonomy for specialized concerns.

### Chaos System

**Summary:** A hidden narrative engine that injects sudden destabilizing events into the game world, creating emergent storytelling through systematic chaos that emerges from system interactions.

**Status: ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED - NEEDS CONSOLIDATION**

**Location**: Scattered across `/backend/systems/motif/utils/chaos_utils.py`, Unity `/archives/VDM_backup/Assets/Scripts/Runtime/Systems/Integration/ChaosEngine.cs`, and world state integration.

**Implementation Notes:** Currently exists as fragmented components that need consolidation into a proper system following the canonical directory structure.

#### Core Philosophy

The Chaos System operates as a **pressure-based escalation system** that creates unpredictable narrative events when various game systems reach critical thresholds. It serves as both a narrative catalyst and a systemic pressure release valve, ensuring the game world remains dynamic and reactive.

**Key Principles:**
- **Hidden Operation:** Completely invisible to players - operates as backend narrative driver
- **MMO-Scale Effects:** Affects regions, factions, and world state rather than individual players
- **Sudden Destabilization:** Creates discrete incident events, not ongoing processes
- **Cascading Externalities:** Events trigger secondary and tertiary effects across systems
- **Emergent Storytelling:** Complex narratives emerge from simple system interactions

**Implementation Pattern:**
```python
def evaluate_chaos_trigger(self, region_id):
    pressure = self.pressure_calculator.calculate_composite_pressure(region_id)
    if pressure.exceeds_threshold():
        return self.select_and_execute_chaos_event(region_id, pressure)
```

#### Chaos Triggers - Multi-Dimensional Pressure System

**Current Implementation:** Only motif pressure thresholds
**Enhancement:** Comprehensive pressure matrix:

1. **Economic Pressure:** Market crashes, resource depletion, trade route disruptions
2. **Social Pressure:** Population unrest, faction tension peaks, mass migrations  
3. **Environmental Pressure:** Natural disasters, seasonal extremes, magical anomalies
4. **Political Pressure:** Leadership failures, succession crises, diplomatic breakdowns
5. **Temporal Pressure:** Anniversary events, prophecy deadlines, cyclical patterns
6. **Motif Pressure:** Existing motif weight thresholds (≥5 individual, ≥4 dual pressure)

**Implementation:**
```python
class ChaosManager:
    """Central coordinator for chaos event generation and execution"""
    
class ChaosPressureCalculator:
    """Aggregates pressure from all game systems to determine chaos probability"""
    
class ChaosDistributionTracker:
    """Ensures chaos events are spread across regions and time"""
    
class NarrativeChaosModerator:
    """Applies narrative context weighting to chaos selection"""
```

#### Chaos Event Framework

**Canonical Chaos Event Table (20 Events):**
- "NPC betrays a faction or personal goal"
- "Player receives a divine omen"
- "NPC vanishes mysteriously"
- "Corrupted prophecy appears in a temple or vision"
- "Artifact or item changes hands unexpectedly"
- "NPC's child arrives with a claim"
- "Villain resurfaces (real or false)"
- "Time skip or memory blackout (~5 minutes)"
- "PC is blamed for a crime in a new city"
- "Ally requests an impossible favor"
- "Magical item begins to misbehave"
- "Enemy faction completes objective offscreen"
- "False flag sent from another region"
- "NPC becomes hostile based on misinformation"
- "Rumor spreads about a player betrayal"
- "PC has a surreal dream altering perception"
- "Secret faction is revealed through slip-up"
- "NPC becomes obsessed with the PC"
- "Town leader is assassinated"
- "Prophecy misidentifies the chosen one"

**Regional Chaos Ecology:**
Events filtered and customized based on regional characteristics:
- **Biome-specific chaos:** Desert drought/sandstorms, coastal tsunamis/pirates
- **Cultural chaos:** Events leveraging local customs, religions, historical grievances
- **Economic chaos:** Target regional primary industries (mining collapse in mining regions)
- **Political chaos:** Exploit existing faction tensions and power structures

#### Cascading Effects System

**Enhancement over current single-event model:**

**Chain Reaction Framework:**
```python
CHAOS_CASCADE_TABLE = {
    "Town leader assassinated": [
        ("Power vacuum erupts", 0.7, "1-3 days"),
        ("Faction war breaks out", 0.4, "1 week"), 
        ("Trade routes disrupted", 0.8, "immediate")
    ]
}
```

**Implementation:**
- **Immediate cascades:** Direct consequences within hours
- **Delayed consequences:** Secondary effects triggered days/weeks later
- **Cross-regional spread:** Chaos in connected regions based on trade/political ties
- **System integration:** Each cascade affects specific game systems (economy, diplomacy, etc.)

#### Severity Scaling with Warning System

**Three-Tier Escalation:**

1. **Rumor Phase:** NPCs spread concerning rumors, environmental omens appear
2. **Omen Phase:** More obvious signs of impending instability 
3. **Crisis Phase:** The actual destabilizing event hits suddenly

**Implementation:**
```python
class ChaosSeverityManager:
    def initiate_chaos_sequence(self, base_event, region_id):
        self.start_rumor_phase(base_event, region_id)  # 1-3 days
        self.schedule_omen_phase(base_event, region_id)  # 1-2 days  
        self.schedule_crisis_event(base_event, region_id)  # Sudden trigger
```

#### Cross-System Integration Points

**Economy System Integration:**
- Chaos creates trade route disruptions, market volatility, resource shortages
- Economic pressure contributes to chaos trigger calculations

**Faction System Integration:**  
- Chaos creates diplomatic incidents, succession crises, betrayals
- Faction tension levels contribute to chaos pressure

**World State Integration:**
- All chaos events logged to global world log
- World state changes can trigger environmental chaos

**Motif System Integration (Current):**
- Motif pressure triggers chaos events
- Chaos events inject "chaos-source" motifs

**NPC System Integration:**
- Chaos affects NPC behavior and relationships
- NPC aggression thresholds trigger chaos

**Region System Integration:**
- Regional characteristics determine chaos event types
- Regional connections determine cascade propagation

#### Narrative Intelligence and Weighting

**Meta-Narrative Moderation:**
- **Dramatic timing:** Chaos probability increases during crucial story moments
- **Genre awareness:** Chaos tone matches current narrative atmosphere
- **Pacing control:** Chaos frequency adjusts based on recent event density
- **Thematic resonance:** Events echo current narrative themes

**Implementation as Weighting System:**
```python
class NarrativeChaosModerator:
    def apply_narrative_weights(self, base_weights, narrative_state):
        # Influences probability and selection, doesn't control outcome
        # Chaos can still override narrative preferences for true unpredictability
```

#### Distribution and Fatigue Management

**Adaptive Distribution:**
- Track recent chaos events by region and type
- Reduce probability for recently affected areas
- Increase probability for "quiet" regions
- Prevent chaos clustering in time or space

**Statistical Balance:**
```python
class ChaosDistributionTracker:
    def adjust_chaos_probability(self, region_id, base_probability):
        recent_chaos = self.get_recent_chaos_events(region_id, days=30)
        return base_probability * self.calculate_fatigue_modifier(recent_chaos)
```

#### Implementation Status and Next Steps

## Introduction

Visual DM is a tabletop roleplaying game companion/simulation tool that brings to life the worlds, characters, and stories from tabletop RPGs. It emphasizes a robust, modular, and extensible design with a focus on procedural generation, rich NPCs, and immersive storytelling driven by advanced AI.

The goal is to create a virtual world that facilitates an adaptive, living, and dynamic tabletop roleplaying experience. Visual DM allows for traditional GM-led play, solo/GM-less play, or a hybrid approach.

## Core Design Philosophy

1. **Accessibility with Depth:** Easy for beginners but with enough depth for experienced players.
2. **Modular Design:** Components that can be used independently or together.
3. **AI-Powered Storytelling:** AI that adapts to player choices and creates compelling narratives.
4. **Procedural Generation:** Dynamic content that feels handcrafted.
5. **Visual Storytelling:** Bringing game elements to life through maps, character portraits, and environments.
6. **Table-First Approach:** Enhancing the tabletop experience, not replacing it.
7. **System Flexibility:** Adaptable to different asset-sets and playstyles.
8. **Living Worlds:** Persistent worlds that evolve based on player actions.
9. **Chaos** Simulating chaos through the complex interplay of disparate systems

## Technical Framework

### Architecture Overview

The Visual DM architecture is built on a clean separation between business logic and infrastructure concerns, following a modular system design where each gameplay domain is encapsulated in its own system folder.

#### Backend Directory Structure

The backend follows a clean architectural pattern with clear separation of concerns:

#### Frontend Directory Structure (Unity)

The Unity frontend follows a clean architectural pattern that mirrors the backend structure and emphasizes separation of concerns:

```

#### Frontend System Internal Structure

Each system in the frontend follows a consistent four-layer pattern that mirrors backend organization:

```
/VDM/Assets/Scripts/Systems/[system_name]/
├── Models/            # Data models and DTOs for API communication
├── Services/          # HTTP/WebSocket communication services  
├── UI/                # User interface components and panels
├── Integration/       # Unity-specific integration logic
└── README.md          # System documentation and dependencies
```

**Layer Responsibilities:**

- **Models/**: Mirror backend DTOs exactly for API communication consistency
- **Services/**: Handle API communication, WebSocket updates, and business logic
- **UI/**: Provide user interaction through Unity UI components
- **Integration/**: Bridge Unity-specific requirements and game engine features

#### Frontend Communication Patterns

Frontend systems communicate through several patterns that ensure loose coupling:

1. **API Communication**: Direct communication with backend systems
   ```csharp
   // Service layer communicates with backend APIs
   var characters = await characterService.GetCharactersAsync();
   ```

2. **Event-Driven Updates**: Real-time updates via WebSocket
   ```csharp
   // WebSocket handlers update UI components
   regionWebSocket.OnRegionUpdated += UpdateRegionDisplay;
   ```

3. **Unity Event System**: UI and gameplay event communication
   ```csharp
   // Unity events for UI state changes
   UnityEvent<CharacterData> OnCharacterSelected;
   ```

4. **State Management**: Global state accessible across systems
   ```csharp
   // Centralized state management
   GameStateManager.Instance.SetCurrentCharacter(character);
   ```

#### Frontend Design Principles

- **Backend Alignment**: Frontend system structure mirrors backend systems exactly
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between data, logic, UI, and Unity integration
- **Consistent Patterns**: All systems follow the same four-layer structure
- **Unity Integration**: Unity-specific code isolated in Integration layer
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for responsive gameplay
- **Modular UI**: Reusable UI components with consistent theming
- **Performance First**: Efficient rendering and data management for smooth gameplay

#### System Communication Patterns

Systems communicate through several well-defined patterns:

1. **Direct Imports**: For tightly coupled systems within the same domain
   ```python
   from backend.systems.character.models import Character
   from backend.systems.faction.services import FactionService
   ```

2. **Infrastructure Utilities**: Shared infrastructure accessible to all systems
   ```python
   from backend.infrastructure.config import config
   from backend.infrastructure.utils import load_json, save_json
   from backend.infrastructure.database import get_db_session
   ```

3. **Event-Based Communication**: For loose coupling between systems
   ```python
   # Systems publish events without knowing their consumers
   await event_dispatcher.publish('faction.conflict_started', event_data)
   ```

4. **Shared Data Models**: Consistent state representation across systems
   ```python
   from backend.systems.shared.models import BaseEntity, TimeStamp
   ```

#### Design Principles

- **Clean Separation**: Business logic (`/systems/`) is completely separate from infrastructure concerns (`/infrastructure/`)
- **Canonical Organization**: All business logic resides within `/backend/systems/` with consistent internal structure
- **Infrastructure Abstraction**: Common utilities, configuration, and database access centralized in `/backend/infrastructure/`
- **Test Consistency**: Test structure in `/backend/tests/systems/` mirrors business logic structure exactly
- **Import Clarity**: Clear import patterns distinguish between business logic, infrastructure, and external dependencies

#### Infrastructure Components

The `/backend/infrastructure/` directory contains non-business-logic components:

- **Configuration Management**: Centralized application configuration and environment handling
- **Core Utilities**: JSON processing, error handling, logging, and common helper functions  
- **Database Infrastructure**: Session management, connection pooling, and database utilities
- **Validation Framework**: Rules engine and validation logic used across systems

This separation ensures that:
- Business logic systems focus purely on domain concerns
- Infrastructure changes don't impact business logic
- Systems can be easily tested in isolation
- New systems can be added without infrastructure dependencies

The architecture follows a layered approach:
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Database, configuration, shared utilities, validation
- **Business Logic Layer**: Domain-specific systems (character, combat, equipment, etc.)
- **Integration Layer**: Cross-system communication, event handling, API routing
- **Presentation Layer**: UI, external APIs, client interfaces

### Core Systems

**Improvement Notes:** Expand with code examples for key patterns.

#### Game Loop
The main execution cycle of the game manages the flow of gameplay, processing inputs, updating the game state, and rendering outputs at appropriate intervals.

#### Event System
The event system enables communication between loosely coupled components through a publish-subscribe pattern. Events are strongly typed and can be processed by middleware.

#### Asset Management
Handles loading, caching, and accessing game assets like images, audio, and data files.

#### Save/Load System
Manages game state persistence, allowing games to be saved and restored.

### Development Workflow

**Improvement Notes:** Add troubleshooting guide and common development tasks.

The development workflow for Visual DM emphasizes:

- Test-driven development for core systems
- Feature branching in version control
- Regular integration of changes
- Documentation updates alongside code changes
- Performance profiling for critical paths

Developers should follow these steps for new features:
1. Document design in appropriate section of Development Bible
2. Create tests for the new functionality in `/backend/tests/systems/`
3. Implement business logic in the appropriate `/backend/systems/` subdirectory
4. Use infrastructure components from `/backend/infrastructure/` as needed
5. Follow canonical import patterns for system communication
6. Update documentation with implementation details
7. Submit for review

#### Import Guidelines

**Business Logic Imports** (within systems):
```python
# Local system imports (preferred for internal modules)
from .models import MyModel
from .services import MyService

# Cross-system imports (for related business logic)
from backend.systems.character.models import Character
from backend.systems.faction.services import FactionService
```

**Infrastructure Imports** (from any system):
```python
# Infrastructure utilities
from backend.infrastructure.config import config
from backend.infrastructure.utils import load_json, save_json
from backend.infrastructure.database import get_db_session
from backend.infrastructure.validation.rules import validate_entity
```

**Shared Business Logic** (when needed):
```python
# Shared business components
from backend.systems.shared.models import BaseEntity
from backend.systems.shared.database import DatabaseMixin
```

## Systems

This section describes each of the core systems in Visual DM, aligned with the actual directory structure in the codebase.

### Canonical Directory Structure

**Reference:** The canonical system directory structure is defined in `/backend/tests/systems/` and must be mirrored in `/backend/systems/`.

The `/backend/tests/systems/` directory serves as the authoritative reference for system organization, containing 35+ defined system directories. Each system in `/backend/systems/` must correspond to a directory in the test structure to ensure consistent testing coverage and architectural alignment.

#### Business Logic Systems (`/backend/systems/`)

All game domain logic is organized under `/backend/systems/` with the following directories:

- `arc/` - Narrative arc management  
- `chaos/` - Chaos simulation and dynamic event systems
- `character/` - Character creation and management (includes relationship functionality)
- `combat/` - Combat mechanics and calculations
- `dialogue/` - Conversation and dialogue systems
- `diplomacy/` - Diplomatic relations and interactions
- `economy/` - Economic simulation and trading
- `espionage/` - Intelligence gathering and covert operations
- `equipment/` - Equipment and gear management
- `faction/` - Faction relationships and politics
- `game_time/` - Time management and scheduling
- `inventory/` - Item storage and management
- `loot/` - Loot generation and distribution
- `magic/` - Magic system and spells
- `memory/` - Game memory and state management
- `motif/` - Narrative motif tracking
- `npc/` - Non-player character management
- `poi/` - Points of interest
- `population/` - Population simulation
- `quest/` - Quest generation and tracking
- `region/` - Regional management and properties
- `repair/` - Equipment repair and maintenance system
- `religion/` - Religious systems and beliefs
- `rumor/` - Rumor propagation and tracking
- `tension/` - Conflict and tension mechanics
- `world_generation/` - Procedural world creation
- `world_state/` - Global world state management

**Note:** Game rules, balance constants, and JSON configurations have been moved to the new multi-tier `/data/` directory structure for better organization and access control.

#### Infrastructure Components (`/backend/infrastructure/`)

Non-business logic infrastructure is centralized under `/backend/infrastructure/`:

- `config/` - Configuration management and environment settings
- `utils/` - Core utilities (JSON processing, error handling, logging)
- `database/` - Database session management and connection utilities
- `validation/` - Rules engine and validation logic used across systems

#### Supporting Directories

- `/backend/tests/` - All test files organized by system, mirroring `/backend/systems/` structure
- `/backend/docs/` - Documentation, inventories, and architectural references
- `/backend/scripts/` - Development tools, maintenance scripts, and automation

#### System Internal Structure

Each system directory follows a consistent internal structure with both shared domain components and system-specific specializations:

```
/backend/systems/[system_name]/
├── models/           # System-specific specialized models and extensions
├── services/         # Business logic services  
├── repositories/     # Data access layer
├── routers/          # API endpoints and routing
├── events/           # System-specific events
├── utils/            # System-specific utilities
├── tests/            # Unit tests (integration tests in /backend/tests/)
└── __init__.py       # Module initialization
```

#### Shared Domain Components

In addition to individual system directories, the systems package includes shared domain components that are used across multiple systems:

```
/backend/systems/
├── models/           # ✅ SHARED CORE DOMAIN MODELS
│   ├── character.py  # Character, Skill (used by character, combat, faction, quest systems)
│   ├── npc.py        # NPC, PersonalityTrait (used by npc, dialogue, faction systems)
│   ├── item.py       # Item, ItemType, ItemRarity (used by inventory, equipment, repair, loot systems)
│   ├── faction.py    # Faction, FactionAlignment (used by faction, diplomacy, character systems)
│   ├── quest.py      # Quest, QuestStatus (used by quest, arc, character systems)
│   ├── location.py   # Location, LocationType (used by region, world, poi systems)
│   ├── world.py      # World, Season, WeatherCondition (used by world, time, region systems)
│   ├── market.py     # MarketItem, TradeOffer, Transaction (used by economy, repair systems)
│   └── __init__.py   # Exports all shared domain models
├── repositories/     # ✅ SHARED DOMAIN REPOSITORIES
│   ├── market_repository.py  # MarketRepository (used by economy, repair systems)
│   └── __init__.py   # Exports shared repositories
├── schemas/          # ✅ SHARED DOMAIN SCHEMAS
│   ├── world.py      # WorldData, Event (used by world, region systems)
│   └── __init__.py   # Exports shared schemas
├── rules/            # ✅ SHARED GAME RULES AND BALANCE
│   ├── rules.py      # Game balance constants, calculations, starting equipment
│   └── __init__.py   # Exports shared rules and constants
├── [individual_systems...]  # All 28+ individual game systems
└── __init__.py       # Package initialization with domain exports
```

**Note:** Game rules, balance constants, and configuration files have been moved to the new multi-tier `/data/` structure:
- **Public configurations** (builder/modder accessible): `/data/public/templates/`
- **System configurations** (internal): `/data/system/config/`
- **See `/data/README_MULTI_TIER_STRUCTURE.md` for complete organization details**

#### Hybrid Architecture Benefits

This hybrid approach provides the best of both architectural patterns:

**Shared Domain Models** for core game entities that span multiple systems:
- **Single Source of Truth**: Core entities like `Character`, `Item`, `Faction` defined once
- **Cross-System Consistency**: No model drift between systems
- **Import Clarity**: Clear ownership and simple imports for domain entities
- **DRY Principle**: No duplication of core domain concepts

**System-Specific Models** for specialized extensions and system-unique concepts:
- **Bounded Contexts**: Each system owns its specialized models
- **System Independence**: Systems can evolve specialized models independently  
- **Domain Extensions**: Systems extend core models with specialized relationships and properties

#### Import Patterns

**Shared Domain Models** (for core game entities):
```python
# ✅ Primary pattern for core domain entities
from backend.systems.models import Character, Item, Faction, Quest
from backend.systems.repositories import MarketRepository
```

**System-Specific Models** (for specialized extensions):
```python
# ✅ For system-specific specialized models
from backend.systems.character.models import Relationship, Mood, Goal
from backend.systems.combat.models import CombatAction, BattleState
from backend.systems.npc.models import ConversationState, AIPersonality
```

**Cross-System Services** (for business logic):
```python
# ✅ Cross-system business logic coordination
from backend.systems.character.services import CharacterService
from backend.systems.faction.services import FactionService
from backend.systems.quest.services import QuestService
```

**Infrastructure Components** (for cross-cutting concerns):
```python
# ✅ Infrastructure and utilities
from backend.infrastructure.config import config
from backend.infrastructure.utils import load_json
from backend.infrastructure.database import get_db_session
```

**Within Systems** (local imports):
```python
# ✅ Local imports within a system
from .models import SystemSpecificModel
from .services import SystemService
```

#### Architecture Rationale

This hybrid model is specifically designed for game development where:

1. **Core Domain Entities Are Cross-Cutting**: Game entities like characters, items, and factions are naturally used across multiple game systems
2. **Specialization Is System-Specific**: Systems need specialized models for their unique concerns (e.g., combat actions, conversation states)
3. **Consistency Is Critical**: Core game entities must remain consistent across all systems to prevent data integrity issues
4. **Performance Matters**: Single imports for core models reduce complexity and improve build times

This approach ensures that core domain models are shared and consistent while preserving system autonomy for specialized concerns.

### Chaos System

**Summary:** A hidden narrative engine that injects sudden destabilizing events into the game world, creating emergent storytelling through systematic chaos that emerges from system interactions.

**Status: ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED - NEEDS CONSOLIDATION**

**Location**: Scattered across `/backend/systems/motif/utils/chaos_utils.py`, Unity `/archives/VDM_backup/Assets/Scripts/Runtime/Systems/Integration/ChaosEngine.cs`, and world state integration.

**Implementation Notes:** Currently exists as fragmented components that need consolidation into a proper system following the canonical directory structure.

#### Core Philosophy

The Chaos System operates as a **pressure-based escalation system** that creates unpredictable narrative events when various game systems reach critical thresholds. It serves as both a narrative catalyst and a systemic pressure release valve, ensuring the game world remains dynamic and reactive.

**Key Principles:**
- **Hidden Operation:** Completely invisible to players - operates as backend narrative driver
- **MMO-Scale Effects:** Affects regions, factions, and world state rather than individual players
- **Sudden Destabilization:** Creates discrete incident events, not ongoing processes
- **Cascading Externalities:** Events trigger secondary and tertiary effects across systems
- **Emergent Storytelling:** Complex narratives emerge from simple system interactions

**Implementation Pattern:**
```python
def evaluate_chaos_trigger(self, region_id):
    pressure = self.pressure_calculator.calculate_composite_pressure(region_id)
    if pressure.exceeds_threshold():
        return self.select_and_execute_chaos_event(region_id, pressure)
```

#### Chaos Triggers - Multi-Dimensional Pressure System

**Current Implementation:** Only motif pressure thresholds
**Enhancement:** Comprehensive pressure matrix:

1. **Economic Pressure:** Market crashes, resource depletion, trade route disruptions
2. **Social Pressure:** Population unrest, faction tension peaks, mass migrations  
3. **Environmental Pressure:** Natural disasters, seasonal extremes, magical anomalies
4. **Political Pressure:** Leadership failures, succession crises, diplomatic breakdowns
5. **Temporal Pressure:** Anniversary events, prophecy deadlines, cyclical patterns
6. **Motif Pressure:** Existing motif weight thresholds (≥5 individual, ≥4 dual pressure)

**Implementation:**
```python
class ChaosManager:
    """Central coordinator for chaos event generation and execution"""
    
class ChaosPressureCalculator:
    """Aggregates pressure from all game systems to determine chaos probability"""
    
class ChaosDistributionTracker:
    """Ensures chaos events are spread across regions and time"""
    
class NarrativeChaosModerator:
    """Applies narrative context weighting to chaos selection"""
```

#### Chaos Event Framework

**Canonical Chaos Event Table (20 Events):**
- "NPC betrays a faction or personal goal"
- "Player receives a divine omen"
- "NPC vanishes mysteriously"
- "Corrupted prophecy appears in a temple or vision"
- "Artifact or item changes hands unexpectedly"
- "NPC's child arrives with a claim"
- "Villain resurfaces (real or false)"
- "Time skip or memory blackout (~5 minutes)"
- "PC is blamed for a crime in a new city"
- "Ally requests an impossible favor"
- "Magical item begins to misbehave"
- "Enemy faction completes objective offscreen"
- "False flag sent from another region"
- "NPC becomes hostile based on misinformation"
- "Rumor spreads about a player betrayal"
- "PC has a surreal dream altering perception"
- "Secret faction is revealed through slip-up"
- "NPC becomes obsessed with the PC"
- "Town leader is assassinated"
- "Prophecy misidentifies the chosen one"

**Regional Chaos Ecology:**
Events filtered and customized based on regional characteristics:
- **Biome-specific chaos:** Desert drought/sandstorms, coastal tsunamis/pirates
- **Cultural chaos:** Events leveraging local customs, religions, historical grievances
- **Economic chaos:** Target regional primary industries (mining collapse in mining regions)
- **Political chaos:** Exploit existing faction tensions and power structures

#### Cascading Effects System

**Enhancement over current single-event model:**

**Chain Reaction Framework:**
```python
CHAOS_CASCADE_TABLE = {
    "Town leader assassinated": [
        ("Power vacuum erupts", 0.7, "1-3 days"),
        ("Faction war breaks out", 0.4, "1 week"), 
        ("Trade routes disrupted", 0.8, "immediate")
    ]
}
```

**Implementation:**
- **Immediate cascades:** Direct consequences within hours
- **Delayed consequences:** Secondary effects triggered days/weeks later
- **Cross-regional spread:** Chaos in connected regions based on trade/political ties
- **System integration:** Each cascade affects specific game systems (economy, diplomacy, etc.)

#### Severity Scaling with Warning System

**Three-Tier Escalation:**

1. **Rumor Phase:** NPCs spread concerning rumors, environmental omens appear
2. **Omen Phase:** More obvious signs of impending instability 
3. **Crisis Phase:** The actual destabilizing event hits suddenly

**Implementation:**
```python
class ChaosSeverityManager:
    def initiate_chaos_sequence(self, base_event, region_id):
        self.start_rumor_phase(base_event, region_id)  # 1-3 days
        self.schedule_omen_phase(base_event, region_id)  # 1-2 days  
        self.schedule_crisis_event(base_event, region_id)  # Sudden trigger
```

#### Cross-System Integration Points

**Economy System Integration:**
- Chaos creates trade route disruptions, market volatility, resource shortages
- Economic pressure contributes to chaos trigger calculations

**Faction System Integration:**  
- Chaos creates diplomatic incidents, succession crises, betrayals
- Faction tension levels contribute to chaos pressure

**World State Integration:**
- All chaos events logged to global world log
- World state changes can trigger environmental chaos

**Motif System Integration (Current):**
- Motif pressure triggers chaos events
- Chaos events inject "chaos-source" motifs

**NPC System Integration:**
- Chaos affects NPC behavior and relationships
- NPC aggression thresholds trigger chaos

**Region System Integration:**
- Regional characteristics determine chaos event types
- Regional connections determine cascade propagation

#### Narrative Intelligence and Weighting

**Meta-Narrative Moderation:**
- **Dramatic timing:** Chaos probability increases during crucial story moments
- **Genre awareness:** Chaos tone matches current narrative atmosphere
- **Pacing control:** Chaos frequency adjusts based on recent event density
- **Thematic resonance:** Events echo current narrative themes

**Implementation as Weighting System:**
```python
class NarrativeChaosModerator:
    def apply_narrative_weights(self, base_weights, narrative_state):
        # Influences probability and selection, doesn't control outcome
        # Chaos can still override narrative preferences for true unpredictability
```

#### Distribution and Fatigue Management

**Adaptive Distribution:**
- Track recent chaos events by region and type
- Reduce probability for recently affected areas
- Increase probability for "quiet" regions
- Prevent chaos clustering in time or space

**Statistical Balance:**
```python
class ChaosDistributionTracker:
    def adjust_chaos_probability(self, region_id, base_probability):
        recent_chaos = self.get_recent_chaos_events(region_id, days=30)
        return base_probability * self.calculate_fatigue_modifier(recent_chaos)
```

#### Implementation Status and Next Steps

- **Concentration:** Many powerful spells require concentration, limiting concurrent effects.
- **Spell Preparation:** Some casters must prepare spells in advance.
- **Ritual Casting:** Casting spells without expending resources by taking extra time.

#### Magic Domains

Represents the source or tradition of magic, which affects spellcasting style and available spells:

- **Arcane:** Traditional wizardry and academic magic study.
- **Divine:** Magic granted by deities and higher powers.
- **Nature:** Magic drawn from natural forces and the elements.
- **Occult:** Forbidden knowledge and pacts with otherworldly entities.

#### Magical Effects and Interactions

- **Magical Detection:** Spells and abilities to sense and identify magic.
- **Counterspelling:** Ability to interrupt or dispel other spells.
- **Magic Resistance:** Some creatures or items resist magical effects.
- **Anti-Magic:** Areas where magic is suppressed or functions differently.

### Memory System

**Summary:** Tracks NPC memories of player actions and world events, with recall, importance weighting, and decay mechanics.

**Improvement Notes:** Add examples of memory influence on NPC behavior.

The memory system allows NPCs and locations to remember events and interactions. It creates persistent consequences for player actions and more realistic NPC behaviors.

Key components include:
- Memory recording
- Memory retrieval
- Memory importance weighting
- Memory decay over time
- Influence on NPC behavior and dialogue

#### Player Memory

Player characters possess an internal memory system that operates similarly to NPC memory but remains hidden from direct player access. This system tracks the player character's experiences, learned information, and relationship history to influence arc generation and quest relevance.

**Key Features:**
- **Experience Tracking:** Records significant events, completed quests, and narrative milestones
- **Relationship Memory:** Maintains detailed records of interactions with NPCs, factions, and locations
- **Background Integration:** Connects character background elements to ongoing narrative development
- **Arc History:** Preserves progression through character-specific arcs for continuity
- **Knowledge Base:** Tracks discovered information, rumors heard, and world lore encountered

**Arc Generation Integration:**
- Previous arc completion data influences new character arc creation
- Background elements resurface in narrative progression
- Relationship patterns affect quest generation and NPC interaction opportunities
- Experience-based difficulty scaling for appropriate challenge levels

**System Operation:**
- Automatic recording without player intervention or awareness
- Memory decay and importance weighting similar to NPC system
- Cross-reference capability with world events and other character memories
- Integration with Core Memory for world-significant events
- Influences dialogue options and quest availability without explicit player knowledge

### Motif System

**Summary:** The Motif System is a sophisticated narrative framework that manages thematic "mood boards" and recurring elements throughout the game world, providing contextual thematic guidance to AI systems for consistent storytelling and atmospheric content generation.

**Core Purpose:** Motifs serve as invisible thematic layers that influence how AI generates narrative content, dialogue, events, and atmospheric descriptions. They ensure narrative coherence and thematic consistency across different systems without direct player awareness or control.

**Key Design Principle:** Motifs are not player-facing mechanics but rather background systems that programmatically evolve to influence the "vibe" and narrative voice of AI-generated content.

#### Architecture Overview

The Motif System operates through a centralized MotifManager that coordinates with other game systems to provide thematic context for AI-driven content generation.

**Core Components:**
- **MotifManager:** Singleton interface for motif operations and lifecycle management
- **Motif Repository:** Data storage and retrieval for motif persistence
- **Motif Service:** Business logic for motif creation, evolution, and application
- **Event Integration:** Publishes motif changes to subscribing systems
- **Location-Based Filtering:** Spatial queries for regional and local motifs

**Integration Points:**
- **AI/LLM System:** Primary consumer of motif context for narrative generation
- **NPC System:** Motifs influence NPC dialogue tone and behavior patterns
- **Event System:** Motifs affect event generation frequency and thematic content
- **Faction System:** Faction motifs influence diplomatic interactions and conflicts
- **Quest System:** Motifs provide thematic guidance for quest generation and progression
- **Region System:** Regional motifs define area-specific atmospheric characteristics

#### Motif Types and Scopes

**Scope Hierarchy:**

1. **GLOBAL Motifs**
   - Affect the entire world simultaneously
   - Examples: "Age of Heroes," "Twilight of Magic," "The Great Convergence"
   - Influence all AI-generated content regardless of location
   - Typically represent major world-state themes or campaign arcs

2. **REGIONAL Motifs**
   - Apply to specific geographic regions with defined boundaries
   - Examples: "The Haunted Marshlands," "Prosperity of the Golden Valley"
   - Most common motif type for location-based atmospheric consistency
   - Include radius of influence for gradual theme blending at borders

3. **LOCAL Motifs**
   - Highly specific to individual locations or points of interest
   - Examples: "The Cursed Inn," "Sanctuary of Peace"
   - Provide immediate atmospheric context for specific encounters
   - Override broader regional themes when present

**Entity-Specific Motifs:**

1. **Regional Motifs** (stored in region data)
   - Thematic atmosphere of geographic areas
   - Examples: "Trade Hub Prosperity," "War-Torn Frontier," "Ancient Mystery"
   - Influence weather descriptions, NPC attitudes, and event types

2. **NPC Motifs** (stored in character sheets)
   - Individual character thematic elements
   - Examples: "Haunted by Loss," "Driven by Ambition," "Keeper of Secrets"
   - Guide dialogue tone, behavioral reactions, and personal quest generation

3. **Faction Motifs** (stored in faction data)
   - Organizational themes and cultural characteristics
   - Examples: "Honor Above All," "Knowledge at Any Cost," "Shadow Operations"
   - Shape faction interactions, internal conflicts, and political maneuvering

4. **Player Character (PC) Motifs** (stored in player data)
   - Thematic elements following the player character
   - Examples: "Bearer of Ancient Burden," "Champion of the Downtrodden"
   - Influence how NPCs react and what types of opportunities arise

#### Motif Categories and Themes

The system includes 48 predefined categories covering the full spectrum of narrative themes:

**Power and Authority:**
- ASCENSION, CONTROL, POWER, PRIDE, WORSHIP

**Conflict and Struggle:**
- BETRAYAL, CHAOS, COLLAPSE, DEFIANCE, VENGEANCE, RUIN

**Emotion and Psychology:**
- DESIRE, DESPAIR, FEAR, GRIEF, GUILT, HOPE, MADNESS, OBSESSION, PARANOIA

**Moral and Spiritual:**
- FAITH, JUSTICE, REDEMPTION, SACRIFICE, TRUTH, INNOCENCE

**Transformation and Change:**
- REBIRTH, TRANSFORMATION, REVELATION, TIME, DESTINY

**Social and Relational:**
- LOYALTY, UNITY, ISOLATION, PROTECTION, TEMPTATION

**Mystery and Knowledge:**
- SILENCE, SHADOW, ECHO, INVENTION, STAGNATION

**Death and Renewal:**
- DEATH, REGRET, PEACE, FUTILITY, HUNGER

#### Motif Lifecycle Management

Motifs follow a programmatic evolution pattern independent of player actions:

**Lifecycle States:**
1. **EMERGING:** Growing in strength and influence (Intensity 1-4)
2. **STABLE:** At full strength and maximum impact (Intensity 5-8)
3. **WANING:** Decreasing in strength and influence (Intensity 2-6)
4. **DORMANT:** Inactive but can re-emerge under certain conditions (Intensity 0-1)
5. **CONCLUDED:** Permanently ended and archived (Intensity 0)

**Programmatic Evolution Rules:**
- Motifs automatically progress through lifecycle stages based on duration and world events
- Time-based decay: Most motifs naturally wane after their duration period (default: 14 days)
- Event-triggered evolution: Significant world events can accelerate or reverse lifecycle progression
- Intensity fluctuation: Motif strength varies within lifecycle bounds based on relevance and reinforcement
- Conflict resolution: Opposing motifs in the same area may cancel each other or create tension

**Evolution Triggers:**
- **Time Passage:** Natural progression through lifecycle stages
- **Event Correlation:** World events that align with or oppose motif themes
- **System Feedback:** Other game systems can influence motif strength through API calls
- **Narrative Completion:** Story arcs that resolve motif themes trigger conclusion

#### Motif Effects and Targeting

Each motif can define specific effects that target different game systems:

**Effect Targets:**
- **NPC:** Influences dialogue tone, behavioral responses, and decision-making patterns
- **EVENT:** Affects event generation frequency and thematic content selection
- **QUEST:** Guides quest generation themes and narrative progression
- **FACTION:** Modifies faction relationship dynamics and political tensions
- **ENVIRONMENT:** Influences weather patterns, atmospheric descriptions, and ambient effects
- **ECONOMY:** Impacts economic factors like resource availability and trade patterns
- **NARRATIVE:** Provides direct context for AI narrative generation systems
- **CUSTOM:** Allows for system-specific effect implementations

**Effect Structure:**
```python
MotifEffect(
    target=MotifEffectTarget.NPC,
    intensity=7,  # 1-10 scale
    description="NPCs speak with subdued tones and fearful glances",
    parameters={
        "dialogue_modifier": "fearful",
        "aggression_reduction": 0.3,
        "cooperation_threshold": 0.8
    }
)
```

#### AI Integration Patterns

**Primary Integration:** The Motif System's primary purpose is providing thematic context to AI systems for narrative generation.

**Context Generation:**
```python
# Example: Getting narrative context for a location
motif_manager = get_motif_manager()
narrative_context = await motif_manager.get_narrative_context(
    x=150.0, y=275.0, 
    include_global=True, 
    include_pc_motifs=True
)

# Result: Structured context for AI prompt generation
{
    "primary_theme": "despair",
    "secondary_themes": ["isolation", "decay"],
    "tone": "melancholic",
    "narrative_direction": "steady decline",
    "descriptors": ["crumbling", "abandoned", "echoing", "grey"],
    "guidance": "Generate content that emphasizes loss and abandonment. NPCs should be withdrawn or desperate. Events should feel inevitable rather than hopeful."
}
```

**AI Prompt Integration:**
- Motif context is automatically included in AI prompts for dialogue generation
- Event descriptions receive thematic guidance from relevant motifs
- Quest narratives incorporate active motif themes for consistency
- NPC behavior adjustments based on regional and personal motifs

#### Data Storage and Location Integration

**Storage Strategy:** Motifs are embedded within the entities they affect rather than stored as separate entities:

**Regional Motifs:**
```python
# Stored in region data structure
region = {
    "id": "western_marshlands",
    "name": "Western Marshlands",
    "motif": {
        "name": "Creeping Dread",
        "category": "fear",
        "intensity": 6,
        "description": "An underlying sense of being watched and hunted",
        "lifecycle": "stable"
    }
    # ... other region data
}
```

**NPC Motifs:**
```python
# Stored in NPC character sheet
npc = {
    "id": "blacksmith_thorin",
    "name": "Thorin Ironforge", 
    "motif": {
        "name": "Lost Love",
        "category": "grief",
        "intensity": 4,
        "description": "Mourning a love lost to war, seeks purpose in craft",
        "lifecycle": "waning"
    }
    # ... other NPC data
}
```

**Faction Motifs:**
```python
# Stored in faction data
faction = {
    "id": "silver_hand",
    "name": "Order of the Silver Hand",
    "motif": {
        "name": "Righteous Crusade", 
        "category": "justice",
        "intensity": 8,
        "description": "Unwavering commitment to purging corruption",
        "lifecycle": "stable"
    }
    # ... other faction data
}
```

#### Usage Examples and Patterns

**Example 1: Regional Atmospheric Consistency**
```python
# A region affected by war
war_torn_region_motif = Motif(
    name="Scars of War",
    category=MotifCategory.RUIN,
    scope=MotifScope.REGIONAL,
    intensity=7,
    description="The lingering devastation of recent conflict",
    effects=[
        MotifEffect(
            target=MotifEffectTarget.NPC,
            intensity=6,
            description="NPCs are suspicious, scarred, and resource-hoarding"
        ),
        MotifEffect(
            target=MotifEffectTarget.ENVIRONMENT,
            intensity=8,
            description="Ruins, burned structures, overgrown fields"
        )
    ],
    descriptors=["broken", "suspicious", "scarred", "desperate"]
)
```

**Example 2: NPC Personal Theme**
```python
# An NPC driven by ambition
ambitious_merchant_motif = Motif(
    name="Relentless Ambition",
    category=MotifCategory.DESIRE,
    scope=MotifScope.LOCAL,
    intensity=5,
    description="Driven to achieve wealth and status at any cost",
    narrative_guidance="This character pushes boundaries, takes risks, and sees opportunities where others see problems"
)
```

**Example 3: Faction Cultural Theme**
```python
# A secretive organization
shadow_guild_motif = Motif(
    name="Web of Secrets",
    category=MotifCategory.SHADOW,
    scope=MotifScope.REGIONAL,
    intensity=6,
    description="Information is power, trust is earned through service",
    effects=[
        MotifEffect(
            target=MotifEffectTarget.NPC,
            intensity=7,
            description="Members speak in coded language and test loyalty"
        )
    ]
)
```

#### Cross-System Integration Guidelines

**For AI/LLM System Integration:**
```python
async def generate_npc_dialogue(npc_id: str, context: str):
    # Get relevant motifs for context
    npc_motif = await get_npc_motif(npc_id)
    regional_motifs = await get_regional_motifs(npc.location)
    global_motifs = await get_global_motifs()
    
    # Combine into narrative context
    thematic_context = combine_motif_context(
        npc_motif, regional_motifs, global_motifs
    )
    
    # Include in AI prompt
    prompt = f"""
    Generate dialogue for {npc.name} with these thematic elements:
    - Personal theme: {npc_motif.description}
    - Regional atmosphere: {regional_motifs[0].description}
    - Tone guidance: {thematic_context.tone}
    - Descriptive elements: {', '.join(thematic_context.descriptors)}
    
    Context: {context}
    """
```

**For Event System Integration:**
```python
async def generate_random_event(location: Location):
    # Get location motifs
    motifs = await motif_manager.get_motifs_by_location(
        x=location.x, y=location.y
    )
    
    # Filter motifs by EVENT target effects
    event_motifs = [m for m in motifs 
                   if any(e.target == MotifEffectTarget.EVENT 
                         for e in m.effects)]
    
    # Use motif themes to influence event generation
    if event_motifs:
        primary_theme = event_motifs[0].category
        event = generate_themed_event(primary_theme, location)
```

#### Advanced Features

**Dynamic Motif Evolution:**
- Motifs can evolve based on world events and system feedback
- Opposing motifs in the same area create tension and conflict
- Successful resolution of motif themes can trigger conclusion states

**Motif Conflicts and Tensions:**
- Multiple contradictory motifs in the same area create narrative tension
- System automatically identifies opposing themes (hope vs. despair, order vs. chaos)
- Conflict resolution through events or player actions

**Temporal Motif Tracking:**
- Historical motifs are preserved for narrative continuity
- Previous motifs can re-emerge under specific conditions
- Motif genealogy tracks theme evolution over time

**Performance Optimization:**
- Spatial indexing for efficient location-based motif queries
- Caching of frequently accessed motif contexts
- Lazy loading of dormant motifs to reduce memory usage

#### API Reference

**Core Manager Operations:**
```python
from backend.systems.motif import get_motif_manager

motif_manager = get_motif_manager()

# Create new motif
motif = await motif_manager.create_motif(MotifCreate(...))

# Get motifs by location
motifs = await motif_manager.get_motifs_by_location(x=100, y=200)

# Get narrative context for AI systems
context = await motif_manager.get_narrative_context(x=100, y=200)

# Update motif lifecycle
await motif_manager.update_motif_lifecycle(motif_id, MotifLifecycle.WANING)
```

**Event System Integration:**
```python
# Register for motif change notifications
def on_motif_change(event):
    motif_id = event['data']['motif_id']
    change_type = event['type']  # created, updated, lifecycle_changed
    # Handle motif change...

motif_manager.register_event_listener(on_motif_change)
```

#### Implementation Notes

**Hidden System Design:** Motifs operate transparently without direct player interface or control. Players experience motif effects through consistent thematic narrative generation but cannot directly view, modify, or interact with motifs.

**Programmatic Evolution:** All motif changes occur through system logic rather than player actions. This ensures thematic coherence while maintaining the invisible nature of the system.

**Performance Considerations:** The system is designed for frequent queries from AI systems, requiring efficient spatial indexing and caching strategies for real-time narrative generation.

**Future Enhancements:**
- Machine learning integration for motif effectiveness analysis
- Dynamic motif generation based on emergent gameplay patterns
- Cross-campaign motif persistence and evolution
- Advanced conflict resolution algorithms for opposing themes

### NPC System

**Summary:** Governs non-player character generation, behavior, personalities, relationships, and development over time.

**Improvement Notes:** Add flowcharts for NPC decision-making processes.

**🔄 ONGOING SIMULATION UPGRADE REQUIRED:**

The NPC System must be fundamentally upgraded to support continuous background simulation of ALL NPCs across the entire world, not just those near the player. This represents a shift from reactive NPC behavior to proactive autonomous NPC life simulation.

**CURRENT LIMITATION:** NPCs are primarily passive entities that respond to player interaction.

**NEW REQUIREMENT:** NPCs must autonomously pursue goals, form relationships, generate conflicts, and evolve throughout the world regardless of player proximity.

#### Autonomous NPC Lifecycle Requirements:

1. **Independent Goal Pursuit:** NPCs generate and pursue personal objectives (marriage, career advancement, revenge, exploration, etc.)
2. **Relationship Evolution:** NPCs form friendships, rivalries, romantic relationships, and family bonds autonomously
3. **Economic Participation:** NPCs engage in trade, accumulate wealth, start businesses, and compete for resources
4. **Political Engagement:** NPCs join factions, seek leadership roles, and participate in diplomatic activities
5. **Quest Generation:** NPCs create and attempt to complete their own quests, potentially interfering with player objectives
6. **Knowledge Acquisition:** NPCs learn information, spread rumors, and make decisions based on accumulated knowledge
7. **Aging and Death:** NPCs age naturally, reproduce, and pass away, creating generational turnover
8. **Migration Patterns:** NPCs relocate based on opportunities, threats, and personal motivations

#### NPC Types

- **Villagers:** Ordinary people in settlements. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** Each villager needs personal goals, family relationships, and autonomous daily routines.
- **Merchants:** Traders selling goods and services. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** Merchants must establish trade routes, negotiate deals, and compete with other merchants autonomously.
- **Quest Givers:** NPCs who provide missions. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** These NPCs should generate quests based on their ongoing problems and objectives, not just wait for player interaction.
- **Allies:** Characters who assist the players. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** Allies should pursue their own agendas and may occasionally conflict with player interests.
- **Antagonists:** Opponents and villains. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** Antagonists must actively work toward their goals, build power bases, and adapt their strategies.
- **Neutrals:** Characters with their own agendas. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** These NPCs should be the most autonomous, pursuing complex multi-faceted objectives.

#### NPC Personality Generation

- **Trait Selection:** Defining personality characteristics. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** Add ambition levels, social drive, and change potential.
- **Motivation Generation:** What drives the NPC's actions. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** Generate both short-term and long-term goals that evolve over time.
- **Relationship Map:** How the NPC relates to others. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** Dynamic relationship networks that change based on NPC interactions.
- **Behavior Patterns:** How the NPC acts in different situations. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** Include proactive behavior patterns, not just reactive ones.

#### NPC Appearance

- **Physical Traits:** Height, weight, and distinguishing features.
- **Clothing and Style:** How the NPC dresses and presents themselves. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** Clothing and style should change based on wealth, status, and life events.
- **Mannerisms:** Unique behaviors and habits.
- **Voice and Speech Patterns:** How the NPC communicates.

#### NPC Development

- **Character Growth:** How NPCs change over time. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** NPCs must grow skills, change personality traits, and adapt to life experiences autonomously.
- **Relationship Evolution:** Changing relationships with players. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** Extend to all NPC-to-NPC relationships across the world.
- **Narrative Roles:** How NPCs fit into the larger story. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** NPCs should be able to change roles (ally to enemy, neutral to important) based on their autonomous actions.
- **Memory and Learning:** How NPCs remember and adapt to player actions. **[UPGRADE REQUIRED]** Expand to include learning from all world events and NPC interactions.

#### World-Scale NPC Interaction Simulation:

**[NEW REQUIREMENT]** Implement systems for simulating meaningful NPC interactions across all regions:

1. **Regional NPC Networks:** Every region maintains active social networks between all NPCs
2. **Cross-Regional Communication:** NPCs exchange information between settlements through travelers, merchants, and messengers
3. **Conflict Generation:** NPCs autonomously develop disputes over resources, relationships, and ideological differences
4. **Alliance Formation:** NPCs form partnerships, marriages, business relationships, and political alliances
5. **Cultural Evolution:** NPC communities develop and change cultural practices, beliefs, and traditions over time
6. **Generational Change:** Children inherit modified versions of parent traits, relationships, and conflicts

#### NPC Interaction & Universal Bartering System

**🆕 NEW FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION:**

Visual DM implements a revolutionary NPC interaction system where every NPC can participate in meaningful dialogue, bartering, and relationship building. This system eliminates artificial barriers between "merchant" and "non-merchant" NPCs, creating emergent gameplay opportunities through universal trading mechanics.

##### Responsive Dialogue System

**AI Response Latency Management:**

Given the expected 1-20 second response times for Llama 13B inference, the system provides immediate feedback while AI processes contextual responses:

**Latency Thresholds:**
- **0ms (Instant):** Context-aware acknowledgments
  - "The merchant looks up from their ledger..."
  - "The guard turns their attention to you..."
  - "The peasant stops their work to listen..."

- **1.5+ seconds:** Thinking indicators
  - Classic ellipsis ("...")
  - "They pause thoughtfully..."
  - "Considering your words..."

- **3+ seconds:** Context-specific delays
  - Bartering: "They examine your goods carefully..."
  - Quest-related: "They recall what they know about that..."
  - Political: "They consider their allegiances..."

- **8+ seconds:** Extended processing acknowledgments
  - "This seems to require careful thought..."
  - "They're gathering their thoughts..."

**Implementation Architecture:**
```python
class DialogueLatencyService:
    def handle_npc_interaction(self, player_id: str, npc_id: str, interaction_type: str):
        # Immediate acknowledgment
        immediate_response = self.generate_immediate_greeting(npc_id, interaction_type)
        self.send_immediate_response(player_id, immediate_response)
        
        # Queue AI processing
        self.queue_ai_response(player_id, npc_id, interaction_type)
        
        # Send periodic thinking indicators
        self.schedule_thinking_indicators(player_id, npc_id)
```

##### Universal Bartering Framework

**Core Principle:** Every NPC can engage in bartering based on their personality, needs, relationships, and circumstances. No artificial "merchant" classifications exist.

**Item Availability Hierarchy:**

**Tier 1 - Always Available for Trade:**
- Personal belongings (jewelry, books, trinkets)
- Extra supplies (food, basic materials, spare clothes)
- Trade goods in inventory
- Non-essential possessions

**Tier 2 - Relationship/Price Gated:**
- Secondary equipment (backup tools, weapons)
- Valuable personal items (family heirlooms, art)
- Professional tools (non-essential)
- Luxury possessions

**Tier 3 - Never Available:**
- Currently equipped armor/weapons
- Role-essential items (guard's badge, shop keys, uniforms)
- Quest-critical items
- Soulbound personal memories

**Exploit Prevention:**
```python
class NPCBarterRules:
    def can_sell_item(self, npc: NPC, item: Item, relationship: Relationship):
        # Core protection rules
        if item.is_equipped: return False
        if item.is_held_weapon: return False
        if item.essential_for_role: return False
        if item.quest_critical: return False
        
        # Relationship requirements
        if item.tier == "high_value" and relationship.trust < 0.6:
            return False
            
        # NPC personality factors
        if item.sentimental_value > npc.attachment_threshold:
            return False
            
        return True
```

##### Dynamic Bartering Economics

**NPC Type-Based Pricing:**

**Peasants/Commoners:**
- Desperate for essentials: 150-200% markup for tools, medicine, food
- Undervalue luxury: 50-75% of base value for art, jewelry
- Practical focus: Premium for functional items

**Merchants/Traders:**
- Market-aware pricing: 90-110% of base value
- Bulk trading discounts
- Premium for rare/exotic goods: 120-150% markup

**Nobles/Aristocrats:**
- Luxury-focused: 200-400% premium for status items
- Dismissive of common goods: 25-50% of base value
- Rarity and prestige drive interest

**Guards/Military:**
- Practical equipment focus: 100-120% for weapons/armor
- Less interested in luxury: 60-80% of base value
- May refuse restricted item trades

**Relationship Modifiers:**
- **Stranger (0.0-0.2):** +50% markup, limited access
- **Acquaintance (0.2-0.4):** +25% markup, standard access
- **Friend (0.4-0.6):** Standard pricing, expanded access
- **Close Friend (0.6-0.8):** -15% discount, rare item access
- **Trusted Ally (0.8-1.0):** -25% discount, full access

**Faction Influence:**
- Allied factions: -10% discount
- Neutral factions: Standard pricing
- Rival factions: +25% markup
- Enemy factions: +100% markup or trade refusal

##### Enhanced Interaction Flow

**Universal Interaction Menu:**
1. **Talk** - AI-powered contextual dialogue
2. **Barter** - Universal trading interface (always available)
3. **Ask About [Context]** - Location/quest-specific inquiries
4. **Give Gift** - Relationship building through item gifts
5. **Challenge** - Combat/competition (context-dependent)

**Seamless Integration:**
- Real-time relationship status display
- Trade history tracking
- Faction standing indicators
- Economic context awareness (local supply/demand)

**Implementation in Character Relationship System:**
```python
class NPCInteractionService:
    def __init__(self, relationship_service: CharacterRelationshipService):
        self.relationship_service = relationship_service
        self.barter_service = NPCBarterService()
        self.dialogue_service = DialogueLatencyService()
    
    def get_interaction_options(self, player_id: str, npc_id: str):
        relationship = self.relationship_service.get_relationship(player_id, npc_id)
        return {
            "talk": True,  # Always available
            "barter": self.barter_service.get_available_items(npc_id, player_id),
            "gift": self.can_give_gift(relationship),
            "challenge": self.can_challenge(npc_id, relationship),
            "context_options": self.get_context_options(npc_id, player_id)
        }
```

This system creates emergent gameplay where players can discover unexpected trading opportunities, build meaningful relationships through commerce, and experience a living economy where every NPC participates according to their personality and circumstances.

### POI System

**Summary:** Handles points of interest including discovery, states, evolution, and memory systems for locations.

**Improvement Notes:** Add examples of POI state transitions.

POIs are dynamic entities that evolve over time through player interaction, NPC decisions, world simulation, and random events.

#### POI Density and Types
- **POI Density:** Each region contains ~20 major POIs (towns, dungeons, etc.), plus 200–400 minor/nature squares (groves, ruins, camps, etc.), with the remainder being wilderness or terrain hexes.
- **Dungeons:** Underground complexes with monsters and treasure.
- **Temples:** Religious sites dedicated to various deities.
- **Towers:** Magical or defensive structures.
- **Camps:** Temporary settlements for various factions.
- **Natural Landmarks:** Unique geographic features with special properties.

## Game Rules

**Summary:** This section provides the core mechanical rules for Visual DM as a tabletop roleplaying game system, with emphasis on differences from D&D 5e.

**Improvement Notes:** Consider adding examples of play and sample character sheets.

### Core Mechanics

#### Dice System
- Uses d20 for most resolution: roll d20 + attribute + skill vs. target number
- Critical success on natural 20, critical failure on natural 1 affects all rolls
- Advantage system: roll 2d20 and take highest (2× advantage: roll 3d20 and take highest)
- Disadvantage system: roll 2d20 and take lowest (2× disadvantage: roll 3d20 and take lowest)
- Skill checks: d20 + attribute + skill vs. Difficulty Class (DC)
- Contested checks: d20 + attribute + skill vs. opponent's d20 + attribute + skill

#### Character Attributes
- Six core attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma
- **Difference from D&D:** Attributes range from -3 to +5 directly (no separate modifier calculation)
- Characters start with all attributes at 0 and 12 points to distribute
- Point costs increase at higher levels: +3 to +4 costs 2 points, +4 to +5 costs 3 points
- Attributes can also be reduced to -3 to gain additional points

#### Skills
- Skills are tied to specific attributes and provide bonuses to related checks
- The canonical skill list includes:
  - **Appraise (INT):** Determine the value of items
  - **Balance (DEX):** Maintain footing on narrow or unstable surfaces
  - **Bluff (CHA):** Deceive others through words or actions
  - **Climb (STR):** Scale vertical surfaces
  - **Concentration (CON):** Maintain focus during distractions or while injured
  - **Craft (INT):** Create or repair items (subskills: Alchemy, Armorsmithing, Weaponsmithing, Trapmaking, Bowmaking)
  - **Decipher Script (INT):** Understand unfamiliar writing or codes
  - **Diplomacy (CHA):** Negotiate and persuade in good faith
  - **Disable Device (INT):** Disarm traps or sabotage mechanical devices
  - **Disguise (CHA):** Change appearance to conceal identity
  - **Escape Artist (DEX):** Slip free from bonds or tight spaces
  - **Forgery (INT):** Create fraudulent documents
  - **Gather Information (CHA):** Collect rumors and information from locals
  - **Handle Animal (CHA):** Train and care for animals
  - **Heal (WIS):** Provide medical treatment
  - **Hide (DEX):** Conceal oneself from observation
  - **Intimidate (CHA):** Influence others through threats or fear
  - **Jump (STR):** Leap across gaps or over obstacles
  - **Knowledge (INT):** Specialized information in various fields (subskills: Arcana, Architecture and Engineering, Dungeoneering, Geography, History, Local, Nature, Nobility and Royalty, Religion, The Planes)
  - **Listen (WIS):** Notice sounds and conversations
  - **Move Silently (DEX):** Move without making noise
  - **Open Lock (DEX):** Pick locks
  - **Perform (CHA):** Entertain others (subskills: Act, Comedy, Dance, Keyboard Instruments, Oratory, Percussion Instruments, String Instruments, Wind Instruments, Sing)
  - **Profession (WIS):** Practice a trade or occupation
  - **Ride (DEX):** Control mounts
  - **Search (INT):** Locate hidden objects or features

  - **Tumble (DEX):** Acrobatic movements to avoid attacks or falls
  - **Use Magic Device (CHA):** Operate magical items regardless of restrictions
  - **Use Rope (DEX):** Manipulate ropes for various purposes

#### Abilities

**Note:** Visual DM uses "abilities" for what D&D traditionally calls "feats" to better emphasize their role in character customization and world generation.

- **Difference from D&D:** No classes or proficiency; character specialization comes entirely through ability selection
- Characters start with 7 abilities at level 1, then gain 3 additional abilities per level
- Abilities have prerequisites and form skill trees
- Abilities may grant skill bonuses, special actions, or unique capabilities
- The system allows for flexible character building, from specialists to generalists

### Health and Damage

#### Health Points (HP)
- Represent a character's vitality and ability to avoid serious injury
- Calculated based on abilities and Constitution attribute
- Temporary HP function as an additional buffer that is lost first

#### Wound System
- **Difference from D&D:** Characters who reach HP thresholds gain wound levels with penalties
- Wound levels: 
  - Unharmed (100-51% HP): No penalties
  - Bloodied (50-1% HP): -2 to all rolls
  - Wounded (0 HP): -5 to all rolls
  - Critically Wounded (negative HP): -10 to all rolls
  - Dead
- Recovery requires rest, medicine checks, or magical healing

#### Armor Class (AC) and Damage Reduction (DR)
- **Difference from D&D:** Both AC and DR exist and function differently
- AC: Determines if an attack hits (calculated as 10 + Dexterity + abilities + magic)
- DR: Reduces damage when hit (derived from armor, abilities, and some magic)
- DR is divided by damage type as detailed below

#### Damage Types
- **Physical:** Basic damage from weapons and physical attacks. Affected by physical DR from armor.
- **Magical:** Generic magical damage. Affected by magic resistance.
- **Fire:** Heat and flame damage. Affected by fire resistance, reduced by appropriate DR.
- **Ice:** Cold and frost damage. Affected by ice resistance, reduced by appropriate DR.
- **Lightning:** Electrical damage. Affected by lightning resistance, reduced by appropriate DR.
- **Poison:** Toxic damage. Affected by poison resistance, less affected by physical DR.
- **Psychic:** Mental damage. Generally not affected by physical DR, only by psychic resistance.
- **Necrotic:** Death energy and decay. Less affected by physical DR, reduced by necrotic resistance.
- **Radiant:** Holy or light-based damage. Less affected by physical DR, reduced by radiant resistance.
- **Force:** Pure magical energy. Affected by force resistance and some magical DR.
- **Acid:** Corrosive damage. Affected by acid resistance, can bypass some physical DR.
- **Thunder:** Sonic damage. Affected by thunder resistance, less affected by physical DR.
- **True:** Special damage that bypasses all resistances and DR.

### Combat

#### Initiative
- Roll d20 + Dexterity to determine turn order
- Initiative can be modified by weapon types and abilities

#### Combat Actions
- Each round, characters get:
  - 1 Action
  - 1 Bonus Action
  - 2 Free Actions
  - Movement (based on speed)
- Trigger actions (reactions) have a specific action cost (action, bonus, free, or movement)
- Trigger actions can only be used if you did not use the corresponding action type during your turn
- Standard actions include:
  - Attack: Roll to hit vs. target's AC
  - Cast Spell: Using magical abilities
  - Dodge: Increases AC until next turn
  - Dash: Double movement for the turn
  - Disengage: Move without provoking opportunity attacks
  - Hide: Make a Stealth check to become hidden
  - Help: Give advantage to an ally's next check
  - Ready: Prepare an action to trigger on a specific circumstance
- Additional combat actions include:
  - Feint: Contested Deception vs. Insight, success grants advantage on next attack
  - Assess: Insight check to identify enemy weaknesses or abilities
  - Intimidate: Contested Intimidation vs. Wisdom save to impose disadvantage

#### Attack Resolution
- Attacker rolls d20 + attack skill + attribute + ability modifiers
- Attack must equal or exceed target's AC to hit
- Critical hits (natural 20): Automatically hit and deal double damage
- Confirmed critical (nat 20 followed by a second hit roll): Double damage and ignore DR
- Double critical (nat 20 followed by another nat 20): [Note: Need to determine effect]
- Fumbles (natural 1): Negative consequence determined by the DM or AI

#### Weapon Categories
- **Difference from D&D:** Weapons are categorized as Heavy, Medium, or Light
- Heavy: Always two-handed
- Medium: Versatile (can be used one or two-handed)
- Light: One-handed
- Each category has associated abilities that grant "proficiency" or other benefits
- [Note: Need to reference abilities.json for specifics on weapon proficiency implementation]

### Magic System

#### Mana Points
- **Major Difference from D&D:** Uses Mana Points (MP) instead of spell slots
- Characters have MP based on abilities and attributes
- Spell costs vary based on spell level and power
- MP regenerates fully after a long rest, and 50% after a short rest
- Some spells are "toggleable" and reduce maximum MP while active

#### Spellcasting
- Spell attack rolls: d20 + spell skill + attribute
- Spell save DC is typically the caster's skill score in the relevant domain
- Four magic domains: Nature, Arcane, Eldritch, Divine
- [Note: Concentration system needs to be fleshed out]

#### Spell Learning
- **Difference from D&D:** No spell preparation or ritual casting
- Spells are learned permanently through abilities
- No class restrictions on which spells can be learned

### Experience and Advancement

#### Experience Points (XP)
- Earned through combat, exploration, quest completion, and roleplaying
- **Difference from D&D:** No milestone leveling option; only XP tracking

#### Leveling
- Characters advance through levels by accumulating XP
- Each level provides 3 new abilities to purchase
- Abilities can only be purchased if prerequisites are met
- System encourages specialization or diversification based on player choice

### Rest and Recovery

#### Short Rest
- No specific time requirement (real-time game world)
- Recover 50% of HP and MP
- Can be taken twice between long rests
- [Note: Consider encounter chance during short rests]

#### Long Rest
- No specific time requirement (real-time game world)
- Recover all HP and MP
- Cannot be taken in dangerous locations
- Chance of dangerous encounter during rest based on region's Danger Level (DL)
- [Note: Need to create encounter tables for rest interruptions]

### Items and Equipment

#### Item Quality
- All items have some degree of magical properties
- Items have quality levels affecting their performance
- [Note: Reference existing item quality system documentation]

#### Encumbrance
- Characters can carry weight based on Strength attribute
- Penalties apply when carrying too much weight
- [Note: Need to define specific encumbrance thresholds and penalties]

#### Item Identification
- **Major Difference from D&D:** Progressive identification system
- Items reveal properties gradually through use or identification
- Identification methods:
  - Purchased identification services
  - Leveling up while using the item
  - Identify spell (if available)
- Items cannot be identified through ability checks

### Additional Mechanics

#### Critical Success/Failure Effects
- Critical successes (natural 20):
  - Attacks: Automatic hit and double damage
  - Skill checks/Saving throws: Automatic success regardless of DC
- Critical failures (natural 1):
  - Attacks: Miss plus potential negative consequences
  - Skill checks/Saving throws: Automatic failure plus potential complications
- AI may interpret critical success/failure with additional narrative consequences

        return self.world_repository.find_worlds(
            criteria={
                'status': 'published',
                'community_rating': {'$gte': 4.0},
                'recent_activity': {'$gte': datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)}
            },
            sort=[
                ('community_engagement_score', -1),
                ('quality_rating', -1),
                ('created_at', -1)
            ],
            limit=limit
        )
```

#### 4. Optional Cosmetic & Enhancement System

**Technical Implementation:**
```python
# Cosmetic purchase system
class CosmeticService:
    def purchase_cosmetic(self, user_id: str, cosmetic_id: str, payment_method: str):
        # Validate user payment
        if not self.payment_service.validate_payment(payment_method):
            raise PaymentError("Invalid payment method")
        
        # Process purchase
        transaction = self.payment_service.charge_user(
            user_id=user_id,
            amount=COSMETIC_PRICES[cosmetic_id],
            description=f"Cosmetic purchase: {cosmetic_id}"
        )
        
        # Grant cosmetic to user
        self.user_cosmetics_service.grant_cosmetic(user_id, cosmetic_id)
        
        return transaction
```

### Infrastructure Economics Analysis

#### Cost Structure Comparison: AWS vs. Self-Hosted

**Current Requirements:**
- 1,000 Daily Active Users (DAUs)
- ~19,000 tokens per DAU per day
- Total: 19M tokens daily capacity needed

#### AWS Infrastructure Costs (Recommended Start)

**GPU Compute (Primary Cost):**
- 3 x A100 instances required (6.48M tokens/day each)
- Cost: 3 × $73.44/day = $220.32/day = $80,417/year

**Supporting Infrastructure:**
- Application servers: 2 x t3.large = $1,200/year
- Database: RDS PostgreSQL db.t3.medium = $2,400/year  
- Redis cache: ElastiCache t3.micro = $360/year
- Load balancer: ALB = $200/year
- Storage: S3 + EBS = $600/year
- Networking: Data transfer = $1,200/year

**Development & Operations:**
- Automated deployment: $0 (using GitHub Actions)
- Monitoring: CloudWatch + DataDog = $2,400/year
- DevOps contractor (minimal): $15,000/year

**Total AWS Annual Cost: $102,777**

**Cost per DAU: $102.78/year**

#### Self-Hosted Infrastructure Costs (Scale Target)

**Hardware (16 x RTX 4070 Servers):**
- Initial CapEx: $48,000 (depreciated over 5 years = $9,600/year)
- Colocation: $12,000/year (conservative estimate)
- Electricity: $1,051/year (20% average utilization)

**Operations:**
- DevOps contractor (25% FTE): $57,600/year
- Monitoring & tools: $5,000/year
- Network & security: $3,000/year

**Total Self-Hosted Annual Cost: $88,251**

**Cost per DAU: $88.25/year**

#### Break-Even Analysis

**AWS Strategy (0-3,000 DAUs):**
- Lower upfront risk ($0 CapEx vs $48,000)
- Linear scaling cost model
- Recommended for early stage
- Break-even: ~$103/DAU revenue needed

**Self-Hosted Strategy (3,000+ DAUs):**
- Higher upfront investment
- Better economics at scale
- Fixed cost amortization benefits
- Break-even: ~$88/DAU revenue needed

**Hybrid Strategy (Recommended):**
1. **Phase 1 (0-1,000 DAUs):** Pure AWS for validation
2. **Phase 2 (1,000-3,000 DAUs):** Hybrid with GPU compute on AWS, other services self-hosted
3. **Phase 3 (3,000+ DAUs):** Full self-hosted for optimal economics

#### Revenue Projections by Strategy

**Creator-First Model Revenue Estimates:**

**Conservative Scenario (40% of previous estimates):**
- Creator subscriptions: $8/DAU/year (15% adoption × $15/month avg × 0.4)
- Creator revenue share: $12/DAU/year (patron tips + premium worlds × 10-15% platform fee)
- Cosmetics & QoL: $8/DAU/year (optional purchases)
