# Performance & Validation Plan: Interaction System & POI Evolution System

## Performance Requirements
- Event-driven integration must support hundreds of events per second with sub-100ms average propagation latency.
- API endpoints should respond within 200ms under normal load (95th percentile < 500ms).
- Event loss rate must be <0.01% (with retry/circuit breaker mechanisms).

## Optimization Strategies
- In-memory caching for frequently accessed POI and interaction data.
- Distributed cache (e.g., Redis) for cross-service data sharing.
- Time-based cache invalidation for data freshness.
- Event batching, debouncing, and coalescing for high-frequency updates.
- Connection pooling for database and event bus connections.

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Documentation completeness (architecture, data flow, API, error handling, performance)
- [ ] Technical requirements validated (throughput, latency, error rates)
- [ ] Error handling and edge cases covered
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Formal review and sign-off by both teams
- [ ] Acceptance criteria met for each integration component

## Phased Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1:** Core API integration with basic monitoring
2. **Phase 2:** Event system integration with enhanced observability
3. **Phase 3:** Performance optimization implementation
4. **Phase 4:** Full production deployment with complete monitoring and alerting

## Monitoring & Observability
- Metrics: event processing latency, throughput, API response times, error rates, cache hit/miss ratios
- Structured logging and correlation IDs for cross-system tracing
- Alerting thresholds for performance degradation
