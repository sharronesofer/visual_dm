# Backend Restructuring

This document summarizes the backend restructuring process that was performed to align the codebase with the Development Bible and create a more maintainable structure.

## Changes Made

### 1. Clean Directory Structure

The backend now follows a clear organizational pattern:

```
backend/
├── api/          # API endpoints and interfaces
├── core/         # Core functionality
├── systems/      # Game systems (domain logic)
├── utils/        # Shared utilities
├── tests/        # Test suite
├── docs/         # Documentation
├── config/       # Configuration
└── main.py       # Application entry point
```

### 2. System Organization

Game systems were organized into a consistent structure under `systems/`:

- **Created 27 distinct systems** based on the Development Bible
- Each system follows a uniform internal structure (models, services, repositories, schemas, utils)
- Added README files to document each system
- Applied consistent Python package structure with `__init__.py` files

### 3. System Consolidation

During the restructuring, several redundant or overlapping systems were consolidated:

- Merged NPC and Player Character systems into a unified `character` system
- Consolidated Quest-related systems (arc_quest and quest_event) into a single `quest` system
- Combined time-related systems into a unified `time` system
- Merged inventory and storage-related systems into a single `inventory` system
- Consolidated faction-related systems into a unified `faction` system

### 4. Documentation

- Added a structure documentation file at `docs/STRUCTURE.md`
- Added system-specific README files explaining purpose and components
- Created this restructuring summary document to explain changes made

## Next Steps

This restructuring establishes the foundational structure, but additional work is needed:

1. **Import Fixes** - Update import statements across the codebase
2. **Dependency Management** - Ensure proper inter-system dependencies
3. **Event System Implementation** - Strengthen the event-based communication
4. **API Restructuring** - Organize API endpoints to match the new system organization
5. **Testing** - Add and update tests to cover the new structure

## Migration Approach

The migration was performed with these steps:

1. Created a backup of the existing structure
2. Established a clean new structure
3. Moved files to the new structure with minimal changes
4. Consolidated duplicate/overlapping systems
5. Standardized naming and organization
6. Added documentation

The approach prioritized preserving code functionality while improving organization.

## Benefits

The new structure provides several benefits:

- **Clear Organization** - Easy to find and understand system components
- **Consistency** - Uniform patterns across all systems
- **Domain Alignment** - Structure matches the game's domain concepts
- **Maintainability** - Each system has a predictable internal structure
- **Scalability** - New systems can easily follow the established pattern
