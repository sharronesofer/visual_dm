# Visual DM Module Restructuring

## What Has Been Done

1. **Modular Directory Structure**: Created a new `/VDM/Assets/Scripts/Modules` structure based on the domain model in the development bible
2. **File Reorganization**: Copied all files from the existing structure to the new modular structure
3. **Documentation**: 
   - Generated `module_index.md` listing all files in each module
   - Created `restructuring_summary.md` explaining the changes
4. **Cleanup Tool**: Created `cleanup_old_structure.sh` to remove old files when ready
5. **Assembly Definition Template**: Created a sample `.asmdef` file for the Memory module

## Current State

The codebase is now in a transition state:

- The original files still exist in their original locations
- Copies of all files have been placed in the new modular structure
- The project can still be built and run using the original file structure

## Next Steps for the Development Team

### 1. Inspect the New Structure (1-2 Days)
- Review `module_index.md` to understand where files have been moved
- Identify any files that might be in the wrong module
- Verify all files have been properly categorized

### 2. Update Assembly Definitions (2-3 Days)
- Use the template in `VDM/Assets/Scripts/Modules/Memory/VisualDM.Modules.Memory.asmdef` as a reference
- Create assembly definitions for each module
- Define dependencies between modules

### 3. Update Namespaces (3-5 Days)
- Rename namespaces to match the new structure (e.g., `VisualDM.Modules.Memory`)
- Update imports/using statements in all files
- Fix any reference issues

### 4. Integration Testing (2-3 Days)
- Run all existing tests
- Manually test key functionality
- Fix any issues that arise

### 5. Clean Up Old Structure (1 Day)
- Once everything is working with the new structure, run `cleanup_old_structure.sh`
- Remove any remaining references to the old structure
- Clean up any empty directories

## Module Structure

The new modular structure includes the following domains:

- **Analytics**: Data collection and analysis
- **Characters**: Character management and persistence
- **Combat**: Combat system and mechanics
- **Diplomacy**: Diplomatic relationships and negotiations
- **Economy**: Economic systems and resource management
- **Events**: Event bus and subscription systems
- **Factions**: Faction management and interactions
- **Memory**: Entity memory systems
- **Motif**: Narrative motif implementation
- **NPCs**: NPC behavior and management
- **POI**: Points of Interest management
- **Population**: Population control systems
- **Quests**: Quest and arc systems
- **Region**: Region generation and management
- **Religion**: Religious systems
- **Rumor**: Rumor propagation systems
- **Storage**: Save/load and persistence systems
- **TimeSystem**: Calendar and time management
- **War**: Conflict systems
- **World**: Global world state and generation

## Tips for a Smooth Transition

- Work on one module at a time, starting with the most independent ones
- Use "Find in Files" to locate references that need updating
- Create a check-in schedule to synchronize changes across the team
- Document any module-specific requirements or special considerations
- Maintain a running list of issues and their resolutions

## Module Dependencies

A preliminary analysis suggests the following key dependencies between modules:

- **Events**: Most other modules depend on the Events module
- **World**: Many modules depend on World for global state
- **Memory/Rumor/Motif**: These are closely interrelated
- **Factions/NPCs/Characters**: These have natural dependencies
- **Quests/Region/POI**: These interact frequently

Refine these dependencies as you update the assembly definitions.

## Backup

A complete backup of the original structure is saved at `vdm_backup_[timestamp]` if you need to reference or restore anything.
