# Weather Effects System: Performance Budgets, Monitoring, and Fallback

## Executive Summary
The Weather Effects System is engineered with strict performance budgets and real-time monitoring to ensure smooth, visually rich weather across all supported hardware. Each weather effect type and intensity is assigned clear limits for CPU, GPU, memory, particle count, and frame time, enforced dynamically at runtime. Automated monitoring tools track system and effect-specific metrics, triggering progressive LOD scaling and fallback modes if thresholds are exceeded. All performance violations are logged, and a developer-facing dashboard exposes live metrics for rapid diagnosis. Budgets and fallback logic are reviewed quarterly and validated by automated tests in CI. This approach guarantees consistent, high-quality visuals while protecting frame rate and system stability.

## Overview
This document describes the performance budgeting, monitoring, and fallback mechanisms for the Weather Effects System. It is intended for developers, technical artists, and QA engineers to ensure optimal performance and maintainability across all supported hardware platforms.

## 1. Performance Budgets

Performance budgets define the maximum allowed resource usage for each weather effect type and intensity. These budgets are enforced at runtime and validated through automated tests.

### Key Metrics
- **CPU Usage**: % of frame time spent on weather effects (target: <5% per frame)
- **GPU Usage**: % of GPU time (if available; target: <5% per frame)
- **Memory Usage**: % of total system memory (target: <10% for all weather effects)
- **Heap Usage**: JS heap (target: <50MB for all weather effects)
- **Particle Count**: Max particles per effect (see LOD profiles below)
- **Draw Calls**: Max draw calls per effect (target: <10 per effect)
- **Frame Time Impact**: Max ms per update (target: <2ms per effect, <8ms total)

### Example Budgets by Effect Type/Intensity
| Effect    | Intensity | Max Particles | Max Draw Calls | Max Memory (MB) | Max Frame Time (ms) |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Rain      | Light     | 250           | 4              | 5               | 1                   |
| Rain      | Moderate  | 500           | 6              | 8               | 1.5                 |
| Rain      | Heavy     | 1000          | 8              | 12              | 2                   |
| Snow      | Light     | 200           | 3              | 4               | 1                   |
| Snow      | Heavy     | 800           | 6              | 10              | 2                   |
| Fog       | Any       | N/A           | 2              | 2               | 0.5                 |
| Sandstorm | Any       | 300           | 5              | 6               | 1.5                 |
| ...       | ...       | ...           | ...            | ...             | ...                 |

Budgets are defined in `WeatherEffectSystemConfig` and `WeatherLODConfig`.

## 2. Monitoring Tools & Integration

- **WeatherPerformanceMonitor**: Samples frame time, memory, and (optionally) GPU usage at regular intervals. Triggers alerts and fallback when thresholds are exceeded.
- **ResourceMonitor**: Collects system-level metrics (CPU, memory, heap, event loop lag) and feeds them to the optimizer and performance monitor.
- **PerformanceOptimizer**: Centralizes metric recording, threshold management, and alerting. Integrates with web-vitals for browser-based metrics.
- **Automated Logging**: All performance violations are logged with timestamps for later analysis.
- **Developer Dashboard**: Expose metrics via `WeatherEffectSystem.getWeatherPerformanceMetrics()` for in-game or dev UI dashboards.

---

## 3. Dynamic Fallback & LOD System

- **LOD Profiles**: Each effect type has high/medium/low profiles (see `WeatherLODConfig`).
- **Automatic Scaling**: LOD is adjusted based on real-time metrics (frame time, memory). See `WeatherLODManager.updateLODFromMetrics()`.
- **Fallback Mode**: If resource usage exceeds critical thresholds, fallback mode is activated:
  - All effects switch to lowest LOD
  - Active effects may be culled or reduced
  - Visual consistency is prioritized (smooth transitions, minimal popping)
  - Fallback is deactivated when resources recover
- **Culling**: Effects are culled based on camera distance (`cullingDistance` in config)

---

## 3a. Ensuring Visual Consistency and User Experience During Fallback/LOD Changes

- **Smooth Transitions**: Always use transition smoothing (see `WeatherLODConfig.transitionSmoothing`) when changing LOD or activating fallback. Avoid abrupt changes that could distract or confuse users.
- **Minimize Visual Artifacts**: Design LOD and fallback variants to maintain core visual identity. Test for popping, flickering, or loss of important cues (e.g., rain occlusion, snow accumulation).
- **Prioritize Key Effects**: When degrading, prioritize the most visually important effects (e.g., keep rain visible, reduce background fog first).
- **User Validation**: Conduct blind A/B tests and user studies to ensure fallback mechanisms do not significantly degrade perceived quality. Collect feedback on transitions and overall experience.
- **Monitor in Real Scenarios**: Validate transitions and fallback in gameplay, not just in synthetic tests. Watch for edge cases (rapid weather changes, hardware stress).
- **Document Known Issues**: If any visual compromises are unavoidable, document them and communicate to the team and QA.

---

## 4. Review & Update Process

- **Quarterly Review**: Performance budgets are reviewed and updated quarterly or after major feature changes.
- **Documentation**: All budgets and changes are documented in this file and in code comments.
- **Ownership**: The lead graphics engineer is responsible for scheduling and documenting reviews.

---

## 5. Automated Testing & CI/CD

- **Automated Tests**: See `WeatherSyncPerformance.test.ts` for tests covering:
  - LOD scaling by distance
  - Memory usage limits
  - Frame time budgets
  - Fallback activation/deactivation
  - Resource pooling and culling
- **CI/CD Integration**: Performance tests are run in CI to catch regressions. Reports are generated and compared to budgets.

## 6. Example Configuration

```
const DEFAULT_RESOURCE_CONFIG: WeatherEffectSystemConfig = {
  poolSize: 200,
  cullingDistance: 100,
  lodProfiles: {
    high: { maxParticles: 1000, minDistance: 0 },
    medium: { maxParticles: 500, minDistance: 50 },
    low: { maxParticles: 100, minDistance: 100 }
  },
  fallbackThresholds: {
    memory: 85, // percent
    cpu: 90 // percent
  }
};
```

## 7. Best Practices

- Profile on all target hardware tiers (min/recommended/high-end)
- Use automated tests to validate budgets before merging
- Monitor real-time metrics during gameplay and in CI
- Prefer smooth LOD transitions to avoid visual artifacts
- Document all changes to budgets and fallback logic
- Add new effect types and hardware profiles as needed (see extension points below)

## 11. Methodology for Measuring and Reporting Performance Improvements

### Step 1: Use Monitoring Tools
- Enable real-time monitoring via `WeatherPerformanceMonitor` and `ResourceMonitor`.
- Access live metrics using `WeatherEffectSystem.getWeatherPerformanceMetrics()` or by inspecting logs.
- For in-depth analysis, export metric histories from the monitor's buffer.

### Step 2: Interpret Metrics
- Compare frame time, memory, and particle counts against the defined budgets for each effect and intensity.
- Watch for threshold alerts (warnings or critical) in logs or dashboards.
- Use automated test results (see `WeatherSyncPerformance.test.ts`) to validate improvements across scenarios.

### Step 3: Document Improvements
- Record before/after metrics for any optimization or change.
- Note which budgets were improved, by how much, and under what conditions (hardware, scenario, effect type).
- Update this documentation and code comments with new findings or best practices.

### Step 4: Report and Review
- Summarize improvements in quarterly review meetings or in PRs.
- Attach metric logs, test results, and screenshots of dashboards as evidence.
- Propose new budgets or fallback logic if sustained improvements are observed.

### Step 5: Continuous Integration
- Ensure all changes are covered by automated tests and CI performance checks.
- Monitor for regressions and address them promptly.

By following this methodology, the team ensures that all performance improvements are measurable, reproducible, and well-documented for future development cycles.
