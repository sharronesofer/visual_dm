# Performance Documentation & Tools

This directory contains documentation and scripts for defining, testing, and monitoring the performance of the Interaction System.

## Contents
- **interaction_system_targets.md**: Comprehensive performance targets, rationale, and test strategies for the Interaction System.
- **monitoring_dashboard_spec.md**: Requirements and design for a real-time performance monitoring dashboard.
- **../scripts/performance/load_test_simulation.js**: Script to simulate concurrent interactions and measure system performance under load.

## Usage
### Running the Load Test Simulation
1. Ensure you have Node.js installed.
2. Navigate to the `scripts/performance/` directory.
3. Run the simulation:
   ```
   node load_test_simulation.js
   ```
4. Adjust configuration variables in the script to match your platform and test scenario.

### Extending the Tools
- Integrate the simulation script with the actual Interaction System API for real-world testing.
- Use the dashboard specification as a blueprint for building or extending your monitoring tools.

## Contribution
- Update the targets and dashboard docs as requirements evolve.
- Add new scripts or tools as needed for profiling, monitoring, or stress testing.
