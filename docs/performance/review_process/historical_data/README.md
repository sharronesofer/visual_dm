# Historical Data Archive

This directory stores all historical performance data, archived documentation, and performance tracking files for the Interaction System.

## Contents
- CSV files tracking performance metrics over time (e.g., latency, error rate)
- Archived versions of performance specifications and monitoring documentation
- Reports generated during review cycles

## File Naming Conventions
- Metric data: `<metric>_v<version>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.csv` (e.g., `latency_v1.0_2024-06-01.csv`)
- Archived docs: `<doc_type>_v<version>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`
- Reports: `review_report_<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`

## Usage
- Add new data files after each review cycle or major release.
- Do not delete or overwrite existing files; always archive with a new date/version.
- Update this README if new file types or conventions are introduced.
