# Documentation Update Workflow

This workflow ensures that all documentation related to performance targets and monitoring tools is kept up to date and that historical data is preserved.

## 1. Update Performance Specifications
- Revise performance target documentation after each review cycle or when targets change.
- Record changes in the documentation change log.
- Archive previous versions in `historical_data/` with a timestamped filename.

## 2. Update Monitoring Tool Documentation
- Update monitoring tool documentation to reflect any changes in metrics, thresholds, or alerting rules.
- Ensure documentation matches actual system capabilities and monitoring coverage.
- Archive previous versions as above.

## 3. Preserve Historical Performance Data
- Store all historical performance data files (CSV, reports) in `historical_data/`.
- Ensure each file is named with the relevant date, version, and metric.
- Maintain a README in `historical_data/` describing the contents and file naming conventions.

## 4. Reflect Project Goals in Performance Targets
- Review project goals and ensure they are represented in the current set of performance targets.
- Document the rationale for each target in the Performance Target Registry.

## 5. Review and Sign-Off
- After updates, review all documentation changes with stakeholders.
- Obtain sign-off and store a record in the review artifacts.
