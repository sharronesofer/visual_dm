# Standardized Performance Review Procedure

This document outlines the formal process for recurring performance reviews of the Interaction System.

## 1. Performance Target Evaluation Methodology
- Review current performance targets in the Performance Target Registry.
- Compare actual system metrics (latency, memory, error rate, etc.) against targets.
- Identify any targets not being met and investigate root causes.
- Document findings and recommendations for each target.

## 2. Historical Performance Data Analysis
- Retrieve historical metrics from the monitoring dashboard and historical data archive.
- Analyze trends, regressions, and improvements over time.
- Highlight periods of significant change and correlate with releases or incidents.

## 3. Monitoring Tool Assessment & Update Checklist
- Review current monitoring tools and dashboards for accuracy and completeness.
- Update metric definitions, thresholds, and alerting rules as needed.
- Ensure new system capabilities are reflected in monitoring coverage.
- Document any tool or configuration changes.

## 4. Documentation Update Requirements
- Update system documentation to reflect any changes in performance targets or monitoring tools.
- Ensure all changes are logged in the documentation change log.
- Archive previous versions of performance specifications and monitoring documentation.

## 5. Stakeholder Sign-Off Process
- Present review findings and recommendations to stakeholders (performance team lead, project manager, etc.).
- Collect feedback and document any required follow-up actions.
- Obtain formal sign-off from responsible parties.
