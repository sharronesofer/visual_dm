# Performance Target Registry

This registry tracks all performance targets for the Interaction System, their version history, justifications, and performance tracking.

| Target Name         | Metric         | Target Value | System Capability         | Justification                | Version | Date Set   | Linked Release | Performance History File |
|--------------------|---------------|-------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|---------|------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| Example: Max Latency| Latency (ms)  | 100         | Real-time Dialogue       | User experience requirement  | v1.0    | 2024-06-01 | v1.0.0         | historical_data/latency_v1.0.csv |
| Example: Error Rate | Errors (%)    | <1          | All                      | Reliability                  | v1.0    | 2024-06-01 | v1.0.0         | historical_data/errors_v1.0.csv  |

## Registry Guidelines
- Each target must be justified and linked to a specific system capability.
- Update the registry with each major release or when targets change.
- Track performance against each target in a corresponding CSV file in `historical_data/`.
- Maintain version history for all targets.
