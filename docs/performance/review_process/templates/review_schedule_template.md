# Review Schedule Template

This template defines the triggers and schedule for recurring performance reviews of the Interaction System.

## Review Triggers
- **Major Feature Release:**
  - Triggered automatically after a new version is tagged in version control (e.g., Git tag).
- **Performance Regression:**
  - Triggered when monitoring tools detect metrics exceeding defined regression thresholds.
- **Regular Interval:**
  - Triggered at least quarterly (every 3 months) regardless of other triggers.

## Review Schedule Table
| Trigger Type           | Description                                      | Responsible Party | Notification Method |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Major Feature Release | After version tag push to main branch            | Release Manager   | Email/Slack         |
| Performance Regression| When regression threshold is exceeded            | Monitoring Lead   | Dashboard Alert     |
| Regular Interval      | Every 3 months (calendar-based)                  | Project Manager   | Calendar Invite     |

## Automation Notes
- Integrate with CI/CD pipeline to detect version tags and trigger reviews.
- Monitoring dashboard should flag regressions and notify responsible parties.
- Calendar reminders should be set for regular reviews.
