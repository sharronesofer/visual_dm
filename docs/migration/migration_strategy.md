# Migration Strategy: Python/TypeScript to Python/Unity Architecture Transition

## 1. Executive Summary
The goal of this migration is to transition from a legacy Python/TypeScript architecture to a modern, modular system featuring a Python backend (FastAPI) and a Unity (C#) 2D runtime frontend. This change will:

- Enable richer, more performant user experiences via Unity's 2D engine
- Centralize business logic and world generation in a scalable Python backend
- Simplify frontend-backend communication using REST APIs and secure webhooks
- Improve maintainability, testability, and deployment automation

**Key architectural changes:**
- Replace TypeScript frontend with Unity (C#) runtime-generated UI and world
- Move all business logic and data contracts to Python backend (FastAPI)
- Use JSON for cross-language data serialization
- Implement secure, stateless communication (HMAC, HTTPS)

**Business value:**
- Faster feature delivery and iteration
- Enhanced cross-platform support
- Improved developer productivity and onboarding
- Robust CI/CD and deployment pipelines

**Critical success factors:**
- Complete feature parity with legacy system
- Minimal disruption to ongoing development
- Comprehensive documentation and diagrams
- Stakeholder and technical lead sign-off at each phase

**High-level timeline:**
- Phase 1: Planning and architecture (this document)
- Phase 2: Backend and frontend scaffolding
- Phase 3: Communication layer and integration
- Phase 4: Migration of legacy logic and data
- Phase 5: Testing, deployment, and rollout

## 2. Current Architecture Analysis

The current system consists of a Python backend responsible for world generation and core logic, and a TypeScript frontend that handles UI rendering, state management, and user interaction. Communication occurs via REST API endpoints, with JSON as the primary data format.

**Component Breakdown:**
- **Python Backend:**
  - API Layer: Exposes REST endpoints for world data, user actions, and game events
  - Business Logic: Implements world generation, rules, and data processing
  - Data Access: Manages persistence (database/files)
- **TypeScript Frontend:**
  - UI Components: Renders game world, menus, and HUD
  - State Management: Handles client-side game state and user session
  - API Client: Communicates with backend for data and actions

**Data Flows:**
- User actions in the frontend trigger API requests to the backend
- Backend processes requests, updates state, and returns results
- Frontend updates UI based on backend responses

**Technical Debt & Pain Points:**
- Tight coupling between frontend and backend data contracts
- Limited support for advanced UI/UX features in TypeScript stack
- Manual serialization/deserialization logic prone to errors
- Fragmented deployment and testing pipelines

## 3. Target Architecture Design

The new architecture will consist of a modular Python backend (FastAPI) and a Unity (C#) 2D runtime frontend. All business logic, world generation, and data contracts will reside in the backend, while the frontend will focus on rendering, user input, and runtime world generation.

**Python Backend (FastAPI):**
- Exposes RESTful API endpoints for world data, user actions, and events
- Handles all business logic, validation, and data persistence
- Implements webhook endpoints for real-time communication with Unity
- Uses Pydantic models for strict data validation and OpenAPI documentation
- Secured with HMAC signatures and HTTPS

**Unity Frontend (C#):**
- 2D runtime-generated world using SpriteRenderer (no prefabs, no scene references)
- All scripts in `Assets/Scripts/[Category]/`, entry point is `GameLoader.cs` in `Bootstrap.unity`
- Handles user input, UI, and network communication with backend
- Uses C# data models matching backend Pydantic schemas
- Communicates with backend via REST and webhooks (JSON serialization)

**Communication Protocols:**
- All data exchanged as JSON (UTF-8)
- REST endpoints for standard requests/responses
- Webhooks for event-driven updates (e.g., world changes, notifications)
- HMAC signatures for request authentication
- Versioned API endpoints for backward compatibility

**Data Serialization & Validation:**
- Pydantic (Python) and C# DTOs (Unity) for schema enforcement
- Automated schema generation and validation tests

**Security:**
- All endpoints require HMAC-signed requests
- HTTPS enforced for all network traffic
- Input validation and rate limiting on backend

## 4. Migration Approach

The migration will be executed in well-defined phases to minimize risk and ensure continuous delivery of value. Each phase will have clear milestones, acceptance criteria, and rollback procedures.

**Phased Implementation Plan:**
1. **Planning & Documentation**
   - Finalize migration strategy (this document)
   - Stakeholder and technical lead sign-off
2. **Backend & Frontend Scaffolding**
   - Set up FastAPI backend with initial endpoints and data models
   - Initialize Unity project with runtime world loader and network client
3. **Communication Layer & Integration**
   - Implement REST and webhook protocols
   - Develop C# DTOs matching backend schemas
   - End-to-end integration tests
4. **Legacy Logic & Data Migration**
   - Migrate/refactor Python and TypeScript logic to new backend/frontend
   - Ensure feature parity with legacy system
   - Incremental rollout with canary deployments
5. **Testing, Deployment & Rollout**
   - Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, E2E)
   - Automate deployment pipelines (Docker, Unity Cloud Build, GitHub Actions)
   - Final cutover and deprecation of legacy system

**Dependency Mapping:**
- Communication layer depends on backend and frontend scaffolding
- Data migration depends on stable API contracts
- Rollout depends on successful integration and test coverage

**Feature Parity Checklist:**
- All core features from legacy system are mapped to new architecture
- Data flows and user interactions are preserved
- Performance and UX are equal or improved

**Testing & Rollback Strategies:**
- Automated tests at each phase (unit, integration, E2E)
- Canary deployments and staged rollouts
- Rollback procedures for each migration phase (infrastructure as code, database snapshots)
- Continuous monitoring and alerting

**Decision Framework (Refactor vs. Rewrite):**
- Refactor if logic is well-tested and modular
- Rewrite if legacy code is tightly coupled, untested, or incompatible with new architecture
- All decisions documented in migration logs

## 5. Technical Requirements

**Backend (Python):**
- Framework: FastAPI (async, OpenAPI docs, Pydantic validation)
- Database: PostgreSQL (with SQLAlchemy ORM)

## 6. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Risk Register:**
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Data serialization incompatibility (Pythonâ†”C#) | Medium | High | Use strict JSON schemas, automated tests, and contract-first development |
| Unity networking/API integration issues | Medium | High | Develop proof-of-concept early, use UnityWebRequest and WebSocketSharp best practices |
| Feature regression during migration | Medium | High | Maintain feature parity checklist, incremental rollout, automated regression tests |
| Performance bottlenecks in new architecture | Low | Medium | Profile early, optimize critical paths, use caching |
| Security vulnerabilities in new endpoints | Low | High | Enforce HMAC, HTTPS, regular security audits |
| Team skill gaps (Unity, FastAPI) | Medium | Medium | Provide training, pair programming, and code reviews |
| Timeline slippage due to unforeseen complexity | Medium | High | Buffer in Gantt chart, regular progress reviews, contingency resources |
| Third-party dependency issues | Low | Medium | Pin versions, monitor upstream, have fallback options |

**Technical Challenges & Mitigations:**
- **Serialization:** Use contract tests and shared schema definitions
- **Networking:** Early integration tests between Unity and Python
- **Deployment:** Use Docker and Unity Cloud Build for reproducibility
- **Testing:** Enforce high coverage and CI/CD gates

**Contingency Plans:**
- Rollback to previous stable phase using infrastructure as code and database snapshots
- Maintain legacy system in parallel until new system is fully validated
- Escalate blockers to technical leads and allocate additional resources as needed

**External Dependencies:**
- Monitor for breaking changes in Unity, FastAPI, and cloud providers
- Maintain up-to-date documentation and migration logs
