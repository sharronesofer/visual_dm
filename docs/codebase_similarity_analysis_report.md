# Codebase Similarity Analysis and Consolidation Report

## 1. Initial Scanning Phase
- Searched for files with similar names/roles using keywords (manager, system, handler, etc.) across C#, Python, and other languages.
- Inspected Unity C# scripts in Visual_DM/Visual_DM/Assets/Scripts/ (all subfolders), Python modules in src/, backend/, and python_converted/.
- Reviewed deduplication/consolidation scripts and prior similarity results.

## 2. Grouping and Classification
- **Unity C# Scripts:** Grouped by Manager, System, Handler, Module, Validator, Processor, etc.
- **Python Modules:** Grouped by Manager/Controller, Config/Settings, Models/Schemas, Utilities.
- **Task Similarity:** Used task_similarity_results.json for prior automated analysis.

## 3. Detailed Analysis
- Many Manager, System, Handler, and Scoring modules are highly repetitive.
- Scoring modules (SynergyScoringModule, UtilityScoringModule, etc.) are nearly identical and can be consolidated.
- Python config/manager modules repeat similar patterns.

## 4. Recommendations
- **Consolidate:** Merge scoring modules into a GenericScoringModule; merge similar handler classes; create Python base classes for config/manager patterns.
- **Refactor:** Extract common logic from managers/systems into base classes/utilities.
- **Remove:** Delete deprecated/redundant files after dependency analysis.
- **Keep Separate:** Maintain separation for domain-specific managers/systems.

## 5. Implementation Planning
- **High Priority:** Scoring modules, handler classes, Python base classes.
- **Medium Priority:** Manager/system refactoring.
- **Low Priority:** Remove deprecated files.
- **Steps:** Inventory dependencies, design base classes, refactor, test, document, remove, peer review, sample implementation.
- **Estimates:** Scoring module consolidation (1-2 days), handler refactor (2-3 days), Python base class refactor (1-2 days), manager/system refactor (3-5 days), documentation/review (1-2 days).

## 6. Next Steps
- Begin with Unity C# scoring module consolidation.
- Draft base classes and refactor as outlined.
- Update report as each step is completed.
- Schedule peer review and sample implementation demonstration.
