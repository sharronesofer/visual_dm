# .NET/Unity Compatibility Fixes

This document records the .NET and Unity compatibility issues identified and resolved as part of Task #718, Subtask 4.

## Identified Issues

### 1. System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IsExternalInit

**Issue Description:**
- The `IsExternalInit` class is required for C# 9.0 init-only properties when targeting older .NET frameworks
- Unity projects often target .NET Standard 2.0/2.1 which does not include this type
- Without this class, the compiler would generate errors for init-only property setters

**Resolution:**
- Added a compatibility shim in `VDM/Assets/Scripts/Core/IsExternalInit.cs`
- Moved the file from the root Scripts directory to Core for better organization
- The shim implements the missing class in the correct namespace to satisfy the compiler

**Implementation:**
```csharp
namespace System.Runtime.CompilerServices
{
    public class IsExternalInit { }
}
```

**Testing:**
- Verified that all code that uses init-only properties compiles successfully
- This shim is invisible to developers and requires no additional imports

### 2. Other Potential Compatibility Issues

During our audit, no other compatibility issues requiring immediate attention were identified. The codebase is primarily using Unity 2022.3 LTS with .NET Standard 2.1, which provides good compatibility across various platforms.

## Future Compatibility Considerations

### Unity Version Upgrades

When upgrading Unity versions in the future, consider:

1. **Removal of Compatibility Shims**: 
   - Check if newer Unity/framework versions include native implementations of the shims
   - Remove redundant shims to avoid type conflicts

2. **New APIs**:
   - Verify that APIs used in the codebase are still supported in the target Unity version
   - Take advantage of new APIs where appropriate, with compatibility fallbacks if needed

3. **Platform Compatibility**:
   - Test on all target platforms after Unity upgrades
   - Add platform-specific shims as needed for broader platform support

### Coding Standards for Compatibility

To maintain compatibility going forward:

1. **Avoid Using Cutting-Edge C# Features** without compatibility consideration
   - For features like init-only properties, records, etc., ensure compatibility shims are in place
   - Document use of newer language features that might cause issues on some platforms

2. **Use Unity's Compatibility Checker**:
   - Run the API Compatibility Checker regularly
   - Address any warnings or errors before they become more significant issues

3. **Reference Official Documentation**:
   - Follow Unity's guidelines for .NET API compatibility
   - Reference Microsoft's documentation for .NET Standard API support
