## Introduction

Visual DM is a tabletop roleplaying game companion/simulation tool that brings to life the worlds, characters, and stories from tabletop RPGs. It emphasizes a robust, modular, and extensible design with a focus on procedural generation, rich NPCs, and immersive storytelling driven by advanced AI.

The goal is to create a virtual world that facilitates an adaptive, living, and dynamic tabletop roleplaying experience. Visual DM allows for traditional GM-led play, solo/GM-less play, or a hybrid approach.

## Core Design Philosophy

1. **Accessibility with Depth:** Easy for beginners but with enough depth for experienced players.
2. **Modular Design:** Components that can be used independently or together.
3. **AI-Powered Storytelling:** AI that adapts to player choices and creates compelling narratives.
4. **Procedural Generation:** Dynamic content that feels handcrafted.
5. **Visual Storytelling:** Bringing game elements to life through maps, character portraits, and environments.
6. **Table-First Approach:** Enhancing the tabletop experience, not replacing it.
7. **System Flexibility:** Adaptable to different asset-sets and playstyles.
8. **Living Worlds:** Persistent worlds that evolve based on player actions.
9. **Chaos** Simulating chaos through the complex interplay of disparate systems

## Technical Framework

### Architecture Overview

The Visual DM architecture is built on a clean separation between business logic and infrastructure concerns, following a modular system design where each gameplay domain is encapsulated in its own system folder.

#### Frontend System Internal Structure

Each system in the frontend follows a consistent four-layer pattern that mirrors backend organization:

```
/VDM/Assets/Scripts/Systems/[system_name]/
├── Models/            # Data models and DTOs for API communication
├── Services/          # HTTP/WebSocket communication services  
├── UI/                # User interface components and panels
├── Integration/       # Unity-specific integration logic
└── README.md          # System documentation and dependencies
```

**Layer Responsibilities:**

- **Models/**: Mirror backend DTOs exactly for API communication consistency
- **Services/**: Handle API communication, WebSocket updates, and business logic
- **UI/**: Provide user interaction through Unity UI components
- **Integration/**: Bridge Unity-specific requirements and game engine features

#### Frontend Communication Patterns

Frontend systems communicate through several patterns that ensure loose coupling:

1. **API Communication**: Direct communication with backend systems
   ```csharp
   // Service layer communicates with backend APIs
   var characters = await characterService.GetCharactersAsync();
   ```

2. **Event-Driven Updates**: Real-time updates via WebSocket
   ```csharp
   // WebSocket handlers update UI components
   regionWebSocket.OnRegionUpdated += UpdateRegionDisplay;
   ```

3. **Unity Event System**: UI and gameplay event communication
   ```csharp
   // Unity events for UI state changes
   UnityEvent<CharacterData> OnCharacterSelected;
   ```

4. **State Management**: Global state accessible across systems
   ```csharp
   // Centralized state management
   GameStateManager.Instance.SetCurrentCharacter(character);
   ```

#### Frontend Design Principles

- **Backend Alignment**: Frontend system structure mirrors backend systems exactly
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between data, logic, UI, and Unity integration
- **Consistent Patterns**: All systems follow the same four-layer structure
- **Unity Integration**: Unity-specific code isolated in Integration layer
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for responsive gameplay
- **Modular UI**: Reusable UI components with consistent theming
- **Performance First**: Efficient rendering and data management for smooth gameplay

#### System Communication Patterns

Systems communicate through several well-defined patterns:

1. **Direct Imports**: For tightly coupled systems within the same domain
   ```python
   from backend.systems.character.models import Character
   from backend.systems.faction.services import FactionService
   ```

2. **Infrastructure Utilities**: Shared infrastructure accessible to all systems
   ```python
   from backend.infrastructure.config import config
   from backend.infrastructure.utils import load_json, save_json
   from backend.infrastructure.database import get_db_session
   ```

3. **Event-Based Communication**: For loose coupling between systems
   ```python
   # Systems publish events without knowing their consumers
   await event_dispatcher.publish('faction.conflict_started', event_data)
   ```

4. **Shared Data Models**: Consistent state representation across systems
   ```python
   from backend.systems.shared.models import BaseEntity, TimeStamp
   ```

#### Design Principles

- **Clean Separation**: Business logic (`/systems/`) is completely separate from infrastructure concerns (`/infrastructure/`)
- **Canonical Organization**: All business logic resides within `/backend/systems/` with consistent internal structure
- **Infrastructure Abstraction**: Common utilities, configuration, and database access centralized in `/backend/infrastructure/`
- **Test Consistency**: Test structure in `/backend/tests/systems/` mirrors business logic structure exactly
- **Import Clarity**: Clear import patterns distinguish between business logic, infrastructure, and external dependencies

#### Infrastructure Components

The `/backend/infrastructure/` directory contains non-business-logic components:

- **Configuration Management**: Centralized application configuration and environment handling
- **Core Utilities**: JSON processing, error handling, logging, and common helper functions  
- **Database Infrastructure**: Session management, connection pooling, and database utilities
- **Validation Framework**: Rules engine and validation logic used across systems

This separation ensures that:
- Business logic systems focus purely on domain concerns
- Infrastructure changes don't impact business logic
- Systems can be easily tested in isolation
- New systems can be added without infrastructure dependencies

The architecture follows a layered approach:
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Database, configuration, shared utilities, validation
- **Business Logic Layer**: Domain-specific systems (character, combat, equipment, etc.)
- **Integration Layer**: Cross-system communication, event handling, API routing
- **Presentation Layer**: UI, external APIs, client interfaces

### Core Systems

**Improvement Notes:** Expand with code examples for key patterns.

#### Game Loop
The main execution cycle of the game manages the flow of gameplay, processing inputs, updating the game state, and rendering outputs at appropriate intervals.

#### Event System
The event system enables communication between loosely coupled components through a publish-subscribe pattern. Events are strongly typed and can be processed by middleware.

#### Asset Management
Handles loading, caching, and accessing game assets like images, audio, and data files.

#### Save/Load System
Manages game state persistence, allowing games to be saved and restored.

### Development Workflow

**Improvement Notes:** Add troubleshooting guide and common development tasks.

The development workflow for Visual DM emphasizes:

- Test-driven development for core systems
- Feature branching in version control
- Regular integration of changes
- Documentation updates alongside code changes
- Performance profiling for critical paths

Developers should follow these steps for new features:
1. Document design in appropriate section of Development Bible
2. Create tests for the new functionality in `/backend/tests/systems/`
3. Implement business logic in the appropriate `/backend/systems/` subdirectory
4. Use infrastructure components from `/backend/infrastructure/` as needed
5. Follow canonical import patterns for system communication
6. Update documentation with implementation details
7. Submit for review

#### Import Guidelines

**Business Logic Imports** (within systems):
```python
# Local system imports (preferred for internal modules)
from .models import MyModel
from .services import MyService

# Cross-system imports (for related business logic)
from backend.systems.character.models import Character
from backend.systems.faction.services import FactionService
```

**Infrastructure Imports** (from any system):
```python
# Infrastructure utilities
from backend.infrastructure.config import config
from backend.infrastructure.utils import load_json, save_json
from backend.infrastructure.database import get_db_session
from backend.infrastructure.validation.rules import validate_entity
```

**Shared Business Logic** (when needed):
```python
# Shared business components
from backend.systems.shared.models import BaseEntity
from backend.systems.shared.database import DatabaseMixin
```

### Builder Support

**Summary:** Details Visual DM's world building capabilities, where builders customize world generation parameters and content libraries to create unique world seeds, rather than traditional game modification.

**Improvement Notes:** Add tutorial for creating a simple world seed customization.

#### Builder vs. Modder Terminology

**Builders** are Visual DM's equivalent to modders in traditional games. However, the term "builder" is more accurate because Visual DM doesn't support traditional mods. Instead, builders customize world generation parameters and content libraries to create unique world seeds. The game generates entire worlds from these customized seeds rather than loading external modifications.

This approach allows for:
- **Consistent Game Balance:** Core mechanics remain intact while content varies
- **Infinite Replayability:** Each world seed creates a unique experience
- **Collaborative Building:** Multiple builders can contribute to content libraries
- **Quality Control:** All generated content follows established schemas and rules

#### Builder Content Types

- **World Seeds:** Complete world generation configurations with custom parameters, lore, and content selections
- **Content Libraries:** Collections of races, abilities, equipment, creatures, spells, and factions that can be referenced by world seeds
- **Generation Parameters:** Customizable settings for biomes, population density, POI frequency, regional characteristics, and world scale
- **Narrative Elements:** Background lore, pre-made factions, religions, and story hooks that shape world generation

#### Builder Tools

- **World Seed Editor:** Visual interface for customizing world generation parameters
- **Content Library Manager:** Tool for organizing and curating game content collections
- **Schema Validator:** Ensures all builder content follows proper data structures
- **Seed Previewer:** Generates preview information about what a world seed will create
- **Content Browser:** Interface for discovering and importing community-shared content

#### Builder Content Structure

All builder-accessible content is organized in the `/data/builders/` directory:

```

- Implemented comprehensive test documentation standards

## Game Rules

**Summary:** This section provides the core mechanical rules for Visual DM as a tabletop roleplaying game system, with emphasis on differences from D&D 5e.

**Improvement Notes:** Consider adding examples of play and sample character sheets.

### Core Mechanics

#### Dice System
- Uses d20 for most resolution: roll d20 + attribute + skill vs. target number
- Critical success on natural 20, critical failure on natural 1 affects all rolls
- Advantage system: roll 2d20 and take highest (2× advantage: roll 3d20 and take highest)
- Disadvantage system: roll 2d20 and take lowest (2× disadvantage: roll 3d20 and take lowest)
- Skill checks: d20 + attribute + skill vs. Difficulty Class (DC)
- Contested checks: d20 + attribute + skill vs. opponent's d20 + attribute + skill

#### Character Attributes
- Six core attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma
- **Difference from D&D:** Attributes range from -3 to +5 directly (no separate modifier calculation)
- Characters start with all attributes at 0 and 12 points to distribute
- Point costs increase at higher levels: +3 to +4 costs 2 points, +4 to +5 costs 3 points
- Attributes can also be reduced to -3 to gain additional points

#### Skills
- Skills are tied to specific attributes and provide bonuses to related checks
- The canonical skill list includes:
  - **Appraise (INT):** Determine the value of items
  - **Balance (DEX):** Maintain footing on narrow or unstable surfaces
  - **Bluff (CHA):** Deceive others through words or actions
  - **Climb (STR):** Scale vertical surfaces
  - **Concentration (CON):** Maintain focus during distractions or while injured
  - **Craft (INT):** Create or repair items (subskills: Alchemy, Armorsmithing, Weaponsmithing, Trapmaking, Bowmaking)

#### Abilities

**Note:** Visual DM uses "abilities" for what D&D traditionally calls "feats" to better emphasize their role in character customization and world generation.

- **Difference from D&D:** No classes or proficiency; character specialization comes entirely through ability selection
- Characters start with 7 abilities at level 1, then gain 3 additional abilities per level
- Abilities have prerequisites and form skill trees
- Abilities may grant skill bonuses, special actions, or unique capabilities
- The system allows for flexible character building, from specialists to generalists

### Health and Damage

#### Health Points (HP)
- Represent a character's vitality and ability to avoid serious injury
- Calculated based on abilities and Constitution attribute
- Temporary HP function as an additional buffer that is lost first

#### Wound System
- **Difference from D&D:** Characters who reach HP thresholds gain wound levels with penalties
- Wound levels: 
  - Unharmed (100-51% HP): No penalties
  - Bloodied (50-1% HP): -2 to all rolls
  - Wounded (0 HP): -5 to all rolls
  - Critically Wounded (negative HP): -10 to all rolls
  - Dead
- Recovery requires rest, medicine checks, or magical healing

#### Armor Class (AC) and Damage Reduction (DR)
- **Difference from D&D:** Both AC and DR exist and function differently
- AC: Determines if an attack hits (calculated as 10 + Dexterity + abilities + magic)
- DR: Reduces damage when hit (derived from armor, abilities, and some magic)
- DR is divided by damage type as detailed below

#### Damage Types
- **Physical:** Basic damage from weapons and physical attacks. Affected by physical DR from armor.
- **Magical:** Generic magical damage. Affected by magic resistance.
- **Fire:** Heat and flame damage. Affected by fire resistance, reduced by appropriate DR.
- **Ice:** Cold and frost damage. Affected by ice resistance, reduced by appropriate DR.
- **Lightning:** Electrical damage. Affected by lightning resistance, reduced by appropriate DR.
- **Poison:** Toxic damage. Affected by poison resistance, less affected by physical DR.
- **Psychic:** Mental damage. Generally not affected by physical DR, only by psychic resistance.
- **Necrotic:** Death energy and decay. Less affected by physical DR, reduced by necrotic resistance.
- **Radiant:** Holy or light-based damage. Less affected by physical DR, reduced by radiant resistance.
- **Force:** Pure magical energy. Affected by force resistance and some magical DR.
- **Acid:** Corrosive damage. Affected by acid resistance, can bypass some physical DR.
- **Thunder:** Sonic damage. Affected by thunder resistance, less affected by physical DR.
- **True:** Special damage that bypasses all resistances and DR.

### Combat

#### Initiative
- Roll d20 + Dexterity to determine turn order
- Initiative can be modified by weapon types and abilities

#### Combat Actions
- Each round, characters get:
  - 1 Action
  - 1 Bonus Action
  - 2 Free Actions
  - Movement (based on speed)
- Trigger actions (reactions) have a specific action cost (action, bonus, free, or movement)
- Trigger actions can only be used if you did not use the corresponding action type during your turn
- Standard actions include:
  - Attack: Roll to hit vs. target's AC
  - Cast Spell: Using magical abilities
  - Dodge: Increases AC until next turn
  - Dash: Double movement for the turn
  - Disengage: Move without provoking opportunity attacks
  - Hide: Make a Stealth check to become hidden
  - Help: Give advantage to an ally's next check
  - Ready: Prepare an action to trigger on a specific circumstance
- Additional combat actions include:
  - Feint: Contested Deception vs. Insight, success grants advantage on next attack
  - Assess: Insight check to identify enemy weaknesses or abilities
  - Intimidate: Contested Intimidation vs. Wisdom save to impose disadvantage

#### Attack Resolution
- Attacker rolls d20 + attack skill + attribute + ability modifiers
- Attack must equal or exceed target's AC to hit
- Critical hits (natural 20): Automatically hit and deal double damage
- Confirmed critical (nat 20 followed by a second hit roll): Double damage and ignore DR
- Double critical (nat 20 followed by another nat 20): [Note: Need to determine effect]
- Fumbles (natural 1): Negative consequence determined by the DM or AI

#### Weapon Categories
- **Difference from D&D:** Weapons are categorized as Heavy, Medium, or Light
- Heavy: Always two-handed
- Medium: Versatile (can be used one or two-handed)
- Light: One-handed
- Each category has associated abilities that grant "proficiency" or other benefits
- [Note: Need to reference abilities.json for specifics on weapon proficiency implementation]

### Magic System

#### Mana Points
- **Major Difference from D&D:** Uses Mana Points (MP) instead of spell slots
- Characters have MP based on abilities and attributes
- Spells have MP costs based on spell level and power
- MP regenerates fully after a long rest, and 50% after a short rest
- Some spells are "toggleable" and reduce maximum MP while active

#### Spellcasting
- Spell attack rolls: d20 + spell skill + attribute
- Spell save DC is typically the caster's skill score in the relevant domain
- Four magic domains: Nature, Arcane, Occult, Divine
- Concentration system tracks active spell effects with save mechanics (see concentration_rules.json)

#### Spell Learning
- **Difference from D&D:** No spell preparation or ritual casting
- Spells are learned permanently through abilities
- No class restrictions on which spells can be learned

### Experience and Advancement

#### Experience Points (XP)
- Earned through combat, exploration, quest completion, and roleplaying
- **Difference from D&D:** No milestone leveling option; only XP tracking

#### Leveling
- Characters advance through levels by accumulating XP
- Each level provides 3 new abilities to purchase
- Abilities can only be purchased if prerequisites are met
- System encourages specialization or diversification based on player choice

### Rest and Recovery

#### Short Rest
- 1 hour minimum duration in game time
- Recover 50% of HP and MP (rounded up)
- Can be taken twice between long rests
- Cannot be taken in dangerous locations

#### Long Rest
- 8 hours minimum duration in game time  
- Recover all HP and MP
- Cannot be taken in dangerous locations
- Chance of random encounter based on region's Danger Level (DL)

### Items and Equipment

#### Item Quality
- All items have some degree of magical properties
- Items have quality levels affecting their performance
- [Note: Reference existing item quality system documentation]

#### Encumbrance
- Characters can carry weight based on Strength attribute
- Penalties apply when carrying too much weight
- [Note: Need to define specific encumbrance thresholds and penalties]

#### Item Identification
- **Major Difference from D&D:** Progressive identification system
- Items reveal properties gradually through use or identification
- Identification methods:
  - Purchased identification services
  - Leveling up while using the item
  - Identify spell (if available)
- Items cannot be identified through ability checks

### Additional Mechanics

#### Critical Success/Failure Effects
- Critical successes (natural 20):
  - Attacks: Automatic hit and double damage
  - Skill checks/Saving throws: Automatic success regardless of DC
- Critical failures (natural 1):
  - Attacks: Miss plus potential negative consequences
  - Skill checks/Saving throws: Automatic failure plus potential complications
- AI may interpret critical success/failure with additional narrative consequences

- **Data Loading:** Robust error handling for missing files and invalid formats
- **Schema Validation:** Working schema validation with fallback implementations

**Remaining Minor Issues:**
- 7 test failures related to specific data file expectations
- Can be addressed in future optimization phases

#### Backend Router Architecture
**Organization:** Modular system-specific routers with explicit registration
- `backend/systems/{system}/routers/` pattern for business logic routers
- Explicit router registration in `main.py` for better maintainability
- Standardized error handling and FastAPI async/await support
- Optional router inclusion with graceful fallbacks

**Router Registration Pattern (main.py):**
```python
# Explicit router registration - CURRENT STANDARD
if faction_router:
    app.include_router(faction_router)  # Include the faction system router

if quest_api_router:
    app.include_router(quest_api_router)  # Include the consolidated quest router

if character_router:
    app.include_router(character_router)  # Include the character service router
```

**Benefits of Explicit Registration:**
- Clear visibility of all registered routes in main.py
- Better debugging and error tracking capabilities  
- Explicit dependency management and import control
- Easier testing and modular development
- Graceful handling of optional/missing routers

**Currently Active Routers:**
- Combat Router (`/combat`)
- Quest Router (`/api/quests`) 
- Population Router (`/api/population`)
- Time Router (`/time`)
- Auth Router (`/auth`)
- Arc Router (`/arcs`)
- Faction Router (`/api/factions`)
- Economy Router (`/api/economy`)
- Character Router (`/api/characters`)

**Deprecated Pattern:**
The old centralized `register_routers()` function has been deprecated in favor of explicit registration for better maintainability and control.

#### Unity Integration Architecture
**Planned Components:**
- **HTTPClient Service:** Singleton service for REST API communication
- **WebSocketManager:** Real-time communication handling
- **AuthenticationManager:** Token management and session handling
- **DataSynchronization:** State consistency between client/server

#### Performance Characteristics
**Data System Performance:**
- 97.5% test success rate indicates robust functionality
- Fast data loading and validation
- Efficient caching mechanisms
- Scalable to production datasets

**API Performance Targets:**
- < 100ms response time for standard endpoints
- < 500ms for complex generation operations
- WebSocket latency < 50ms
- Support for 100+ concurrent connections

### Integration Patterns

#### Client-Server Communication
1. **Authentication Flow:** JWT token-based with refresh capability
2. **API Requests:** RESTful operations with standardized DTOs
3. **Real-time Events:** WebSocket for immediate updates
4. **Error Recovery:** Automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
5. **Offline Support:** Local caching for critical game state

#### Cross-System Integration
1. **Event-Driven Architecture:** Loose coupling via event bus
2. **Service Layer:** Business logic separation from API endpoints
3. **Repository Pattern:** Data access abstraction
4. **Dependency Injection:** Testable and maintainable component structure

#### Development Workflow
1. **API-First Design:** Contracts defined before implementation
2. **Test-Driven Development:** High test coverage for critical systems

**Technical Implementation:**
```python
# Discovery algorithm prioritizes engagement over payment
class WorldDiscoveryService:
    def get_featured_worlds(self, limit: int = 20):
        return self.world_repository.find_worlds(
            criteria={
                'status': 'published',
                'community_rating': {'$gte': 4.0},
                'recent_activity': {'$gte': datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)}
            },
            sort=[
                ('community_engagement_score', -1),
                ('quality_rating', -1),
                ('created_at', -1)
            ],
            limit=limit
        )
```

#### 4. Optional Cosmetic & Enhancement System

**Philosophy:** Purely optional, never pay-to-win.

**Cosmetic Options:**
- Avatar customization: $2-8 per outfit/accessory
- Custom UI themes: $3-5 per theme pack
- Profile badges and frames: $1-3 per item
- Animated emotes: $1-2 per emote

**Quality of Life Enhancements:**
- Additional save slots: $5 for 10 extra slots
- Cloud save backup: $3/month for automated backups
- Priority matchmaking: $5/month for faster connections
- Advanced analytics: $8/month for detailed play statistics

**Technical Implementation:**
```python
# Cosmetic purchase system
class CosmeticService:
    def purchase_cosmetic(self, user_id: str, cosmetic_id: str, payment_method: str):
        # Validate user payment
        if not self.payment_service.validate_payment(payment_method):
            raise PaymentError("Invalid payment method")
        
        # Process purchase
        transaction = self.payment_service.charge_user(
            user_id=user_id,
            amount=COSMETIC_PRICES[cosmetic_id],
            description=f"Cosmetic purchase: {cosmetic_id}"
        )
        
        # Grant cosmetic to user
        self.user_cosmetics_service.grant_cosmetic(user_id, cosmetic_id)
        
        return transaction
```

- **Military**: 1.5x durability multiplier, combat-grade construction built for war
- **Mastercraft**: 2.5x durability multiplier, artisan-level craftsmanship using finest materials

**Rarity Tiers (Affects Magical Properties):**
- **Common**: 1 enchantment slot, baseline magical potential
- **Rare**: 2 enchantment slots, enhanced magical capabilities  
- **Epic**: 3 enchantment slots, powerful magical enhancements
- **Legendary**: 4 enchantment slots, mythical magical powers

**Independent Classification:** Every equipment instance has both quality AND rarity, allowing combinations like "Mastercraft Common" (extremely durable but minimal magic) or "Basic Legendary" (fragile but incredibly powerful).

#### **Equipment Slots & Sets**

**12 Equipment Slots Total:**
- **Weapons**: Main hand, off-hand
- **Armor**: Chest, pants, boots, gloves, hat
- **Accessories**: Ring 1, ring 2, amulet, earring 1, earring 2

**Equipment Sets (12 Total):**
- **Combat Sets**: Warrior, Paladin, Berserker, Assassin, Ranger, Demon Hunter
- **Magic Sets**: Mage, Necromancer, Druid, Elementalist
- **Utility Sets**: Scholar, Monk

#### **Durability & Maintenance System**

**Usage-Based Degradation:**
- Equipment loses durability through use, not time passage
- Quality tier determines total lifespan (basic: 168 uses, military: 336 uses, mastercraft: 672 uses)
- Environmental factors and critical hits accelerate degradation

**Condition Effects:**
- **Excellent (90-100%)**: No penalties, maximum effectiveness
- **Good (75-89%)**: No penalties, normal wear visible
- **Worn (50-74%)**: 10% stat reduction, visible damage
- **Damaged (25-49%)**: 25% stat reduction, significant damage
- **Very Damaged (10-24%)**: 50% stat reduction, barely functional
- **Broken (0-9%)**: Cannot be equipped, provides no benefits

**Set Bonus Requirements:**
- Equipment must maintain ≥30% durability to contribute to set bonuses
- Encourages proactive maintenance and creates meaningful repair economy

#### **Enchantment & Magical Effects**

**Rarity-Based Enchantment Capacity:**
- Each rarity tier supports specific number of simultaneous enchantments
- Higher rarity allows more powerful enchantment schools (mystical effects only on legendary)
- Enchantment power scales with rarity (legendary = 2x power of common)

**Enchantment Schools:**
- **Enhancement**: Stat bonuses and combat improvements
- **Utility**: Quality of life and convenience effects
- **Protective**: Defensive bonuses and damage resistance
- **Elemental**: Fire, ice, lightning, and nature magic
- **Mystical**: Reality-bending effects (legendary only)

#### **Economic Integration**

**Quality-Based Economics:**
- Repair costs scale with quality tier (mastercraft costs 2x basic)
- Higher quality requires more skilled craftsmen and rare materials
- Quality affects base item value and resale worth

**Rarity-Based Value:**
- Rarity dramatically affects market value (legendary = 20x common)
- Identification required for magical items (difficulty scales with rarity)
- Drop rate weights create realistic loot distribution

#### **Technical Implementation**

**Database Schema:**
```sql
equipment_instances (
    id, character_id, template_id, slot,
    current_durability, max_durability, usage_count,
    quality_tier, rarity_tier, enchantment_seed,

**Architecture:** Protocol-based business logic architecture with comprehensive hidden attribute modeling and behavioral prediction algorithms.

**Implementation Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Full sophisticated hidden attributes system, power scoring algorithms, stability assessment, behavioral prediction, API endpoints, alliance/diplomacy integration, and comprehensive JSON configuration repository implemented.

#### Hidden Attributes System

**Core Hidden Attributes:**
- **Hidden Ambition (1-10):** Drive for expansion and power acquisition
- **Hidden Integrity (1-10):** Adherence to principles and trustworthiness  
- **Hidden Discipline (1-10):** Organizational control and structure
- **Hidden Impulsivity (1-10):** Tendency toward quick, emotional decisions
- **Hidden Pragmatism (1-10):** Focus on practical outcomes over ideals
- **Hidden Resilience (1-10):** Ability to recover from setbacks

**Attribute Impact on Behavior:**
```python
# Example faction with high ambition + low integrity
faction_attributes = {
    'hidden_ambition': 9,      # Very aggressive expansion
    'hidden_integrity': 3,     # Willing to break agreements
    'hidden_discipline': 7,    # Well-organized efforts
    'hidden_impulsivity': 6,   # Moderate decision speed
    'hidden_pragmatism': 8,    # Results-focused approach
    'hidden_resilience': 5     # Average recovery ability
}

# Results in: Aggressive, untrustworthy faction that pursues expansion
# through organized but morally flexible means
```

#### Power Score Calculation Algorithm

**Multi-Factor Power Assessment:**
```python
def calculate_faction_power_score(faction: FactionData) -> float:
    """
    Calculate comprehensive faction power score (0.0-100.0)
    Combines hidden attributes with weighted importance factors
    """
    base_power = (
        faction.hidden_ambition * 0.25 +      # Drive for power (25%)
        faction.hidden_discipline * 0.20 +    # Organizational strength (20%)
        faction.hidden_pragmatism * 0.15 +    # Strategic effectiveness (15%)
        faction.hidden_resilience * 0.15 +    # Sustainability (15%)
        faction.hidden_integrity * 0.10 +     # Trustworthiness factor (10%)
        (10 - faction.hidden_impulsivity) * 0.15  # Strategic patience (15%)
    )
    
    # Normalize to 0-100 scale
    return min(100.0, max(0.0, base_power * 10))
```

**Power Categories:**
- **Dominant (80-100):** Regional superpowers with extensive influence
- **Major (60-79):** Significant political players with substantial resources
- **Moderate (40-59):** Established factions with regional influence
- **Minor (20-39):** Local organizations with limited reach
- **Negligible (0-19):** Weak or declining factions with minimal impact

#### Stability Assessment System

**Stability Calculation:**
```python
def assess_faction_stability(faction: FactionData) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Assess faction internal stability and predict potential issues
    """
    # Core stability factors
    discipline_stability = faction.hidden_discipline / 10.0
    integrity_consistency = faction.hidden_integrity / 10.0
    resilience_factor = faction.hidden_resilience / 10.0
    
    # Risk factors
    impulsivity_risk = faction.hidden_impulsivity / 10.0
    ambition_overreach = max(0, (faction.hidden_ambition - 7)) / 3.0
    
    # Calculate overall stability (0.0-1.0)
    stability_score = (
        discipline_stability * 0.30 +
        integrity_consistency * 0.25 +
        resilience_factor * 0.25 +
        (1.0 - impulsivity_risk) * 0.10 +
        (1.0 - ambition_overreach) * 0.10
    )
    
    return {
        'stability_score': stability_score,
        'risk_factors': assess_risk_factors(faction),
        'predicted_issues': predict_stability_issues(faction)
    }
```

**Stability Categories:**
- **Highly Stable (0.8-1.0):** Well-organized, predictable factions
- **Stable (0.6-0.79):** Reliable with occasional internal tensions
- **Unstable (0.4-0.59):** Prone to internal conflicts and policy shifts
- **Volatile (0.2-0.39):** Frequent leadership changes and direction shifts
- **Chaotic (0.0-0.19):** Barely functional, constant internal strife

#### Behavioral Prediction Functions

**Tendency Analysis:**
```python
def predict_faction_behavior_tendencies(faction: FactionData) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Predict faction behavioral patterns based on hidden attributes
    """
    # Diplomatic tendencies
    diplomatic_style = {
        'aggressive': (faction.hidden_ambition + faction.hidden_impulsivity) / 20.0,
        'cooperative': (faction.hidden_integrity + faction.hidden_pragmatism) / 20.0,
        'isolationist': (faction.hidden_discipline + (10 - faction.hidden_ambition)) / 20.0,
        'opportunistic': (faction.hidden_pragmatism + (10 - faction.hidden_integrity)) / 20.0
    }
    
    # Decision-making patterns
    decision_patterns = {
        'calculated': (faction.hidden_discipline + (10 - faction.hidden_impulsivity)) / 20.0,
        'reactive': (faction.hidden_impulsivity + faction.hidden_ambition) / 20.0,
        'adaptive': (faction.hidden_pragmatism + faction.hidden_resilience) / 20.0,
        'traditional': (faction.hidden_integrity + faction.hidden_discipline) / 20.0
    }
    
    return {
        'diplomatic_style': diplomatic_style,
        'decision_patterns': decision_patterns,
        'predicted_actions': generate_action_predictions(faction)

### **POI System**

**Summary:** The Points of Interest (POI) system manages all significant locations in the game world, including cities, towns, villages, fortresses, mines, dungeons, ruins, and other notable places. The system handles procedural generation, economic simulation, population dynamics, political control, and complex state transitions.

**Architecture:** Protocol-based business logic architecture with comprehensive state management, resource simulation, and cross-system integration following clean separation of concerns.

#### Core Components

**1. Core POI Management (`PoiBusinessService`)**
- **Business Logic:** Pure domain logic for creating, updating, querying, and lifecycle management of POI entities
- **Validation:** Business rule enforcement (name uniqueness, population limits, capacity constraints)
- **Data Models:** `PoiData`, `CreatePoiData`, `UpdatePoiData` with comprehensive field validation
- **Repository Protocol:** `PoiRepository` for data access abstraction

**2. State Transition System (`POIStateBusinessService`)**
- **State Machine:** Configuration-driven state transitions with validation rules
- **States:** `active`, `inactive`, `abandoned`, `ruined`, `under_construction`, `declining`, `growing`, `normal`, `ruins`, `dungeon`, `repopulating`, `special`
- **Transition Validation:** `StateTransitionValidator` with population, resource, and faction requirements
- **Event System:** `StateTransitionEvent` with metadata tracking and cross-system notifications

**3. POI Types and Interaction Types**
- **POI Types:** `city`, `village`, `town`, `settlement`, `outpost`, `fortress`, `temple`, `market`, `mine`, `other`
- **Interaction Types:** `trade`, `diplomacy`, `combat`, `exploration`, `quest`, `social`, `neutral`
- **Type-Specific Rules:** Different generation parameters, state transition modifiers, and gameplay mechanics per type

#### Advanced Subsystems

**4. Economic Simulation (`ResourceManagementService`)**
- **Resource Types:** Production, consumption, storage, and quality tracking
- **Trade System:** Inter-POI trading with offers, routes, and market dynamics
- **Economic Health:** Prosperity calculations based on resource abundance and trade activity

**5. Population Dynamics (`MigrationService`)**
- **Migration Types:** Voluntary, forced, seasonal, trade-based, refugee movements
- **Demographic Tracking:** Age distribution, occupations, cultural groups
- **Population Flow:** Route safety, travel time, capacity limits, and success rates

**6. Political Control (`FactionInfluenceService`)**
- **Influence Types:** Political, economic, cultural, military influence tracking
- **Faction Relations:** Allied, neutral, hostile relationships affecting interactions
- **Control Mechanics:** Faction treasury, investment costs, and influence actions

**7. Urban Development (`MetropolitanSpreadService`)**
- **City Growth:** Hexagonal expansion patterns with economic and population thresholds
- **Metropolitan Areas:** Multi-POI urban regions with shared infrastructure
- **Development Costs:** Economic requirements for expansion and growth

#### State Transition Examples

**Growth Cycle:**
```
normal → growing (population increase + resource abundance)
growing → active (population stabilization)
active → declining (resource shortage + population decrease)
declining → abandoned (critical population + resource crisis)
abandoned → ruins (time passage + no maintenance)
```

**Recovery Cycle:**
```
ruins → under_construction (major reconstruction + massive investment)
under_construction → active (construction completion + population settlement)
abandoned → repopulating (faction investment + repopulation effort)
repopulating → active (population success + resource establishment)
```

#### Data Models and Validation

**Core POI Model:**
```python
class PointOfInterest:
    id: UUID
    name: str
    description: Optional[str]
    poi_type: POIType  # city, town, village, etc.
    state: POIState    # active, declining, ruins, etc.
    interaction_type: POIInteractionType  # trade, combat, social, etc.
    location_x/y/z: Optional[float]
    region_id: Optional[UUID]
    faction_id: Optional[UUID]
    population: Optional[int]
    max_population: Optional[int]
    resources: Dict[str, Any]
    properties: Dict[str, Any]
```

**Business Rules:**
- POI names must be unique within the system
- Population cannot exceed max_population capacity
- State transitions require specific conditions (population thresholds, resource levels, faction control)
- Some transitions require faction investment and time requirements
- Location coordinates and region association for spatial queries

#### Configuration-Driven Architecture

**Generation Rules (`poi_generation_rules.json`):**
- Biome preferences and avoidance patterns
- Minimum distance constraints between same-type POIs
- Population scaling factors and resource requirements
- Elevation preferences and trade route requirements

**State Transitions (`state_transitions.json`):**
- Complete transition matrix with required conditions
- Population and resource thresholds for each transition
- Time requirements and probability modifiers
- Faction investment costs and influence requirements

#### API Contracts

**POI Creation:**
```python
POST /api/poi/
{
  "name": "Oakvale",
  "poi_type": "village",
  "interaction_type": "social",
  "population": 120,
  "max_population": 200,
  "location_x": 150.5,
  "location_y": 75.2
}
```

**State Transition:**
```python
POST /api/poi/{id}/transition
{
  "target_state": "growing",
  "reason": "Economic boom from new trade route",
  "conditions": ["population_increase", "resource_abundance"]
}
```

#### Integration Points

**Cross-System Dependencies:**
- **Region System:** POIs belong to regions and inherit environmental modifiers
- **Faction System:** Political control affects state transitions and economic activities  
- **Economy System:** Resource production, consumption, and trade route management
- **Population System:** Migration flows between POIs based on conditions and opportunities
- **Time System:** Environmental degradation, seasonal modifiers, and event scheduling

**Event Integration:**
- State transition events published to other systems
- Population change notifications trigger migration calculations
- Economic events affect resource levels and trade opportunities
- Faction control changes influence diplomatic relations

#### Infrastructure Separation

**Business Logic (systems/poi/):**
- Pure domain services with protocol-based dependency injection
- Business rule validation and state management logic
- Cross-system event publishing and subscription

**Infrastructure (infrastructure/poi_*):**
- Database repositories and data access layer
- Procedural generation algorithms and tilemap services

- **✅ Comprehensive Damage Modeling:** Added time-based, combat, and environmental degradation calculations
- **✅ Intelligent Repair System:** Enhanced `RepairService` with success/failure mechanics and cost optimization
- **✅ Condition-Based Penalties:** Implemented equipment stat penalties based on durability condition

#### Current Architecture (Post-Fix)

The repair and durability system now follows a clean, centralized architecture:

**1. Core Durability Service (`DurabilityService`)**
- **Centralized Calculations:** All durability math consolidated into one service
- **Comprehensive Degradation:** Handles time-based, combat, and environmental wear
- **Condition Management:** Maps durability percentages to condition states and penalties
- **Repair Cost Calculations:** Unified cost and time estimation algorithms

#### Equipment Condition System

Equipment now has a sophisticated condition system affecting functionality:

**Condition Thresholds:**
- **Perfect (100%):** No penalties, maximum effectiveness
- **Excellent (90-99%):** No penalties, slight wear visible
- **Good (75-89%):** No penalties, normal wear
- **Worn (50-74%):** 10% stat reduction, visible damage
- **Damaged (25-49%):** 25% stat reduction, significant damage
- **Very Damaged (10-24%):** 50% stat reduction, barely functional
- **Broken (0-9%):** Cannot be equipped or used

**Stat Penalty Application:**
```python
# Example: A weapon with 30% durability (damaged condition)
base_attack_bonus = +5
effective_attack_bonus = +5 * (1 - 0.25) = +3.75 = +4 (rounded)
```

#### Memory System

**Summary:** NPCs maintain sophisticated memory systems that track interactions, experiences, and relationships. Memories have importance and relevance scores, decay over time based on JSON configuration, and influence NPC behavior through trust calculations and emotional responses.

**Core Memory Features:**
- **Dual Scoring System:** Memories use both importance (permanence) and relevance (current usefulness) scores
- **Category-Based Organization:** Memories are categorized (trauma, achievement, relationship, etc.) with category-specific decay modifiers
- **JSON Configuration:** All decay rates, trust calculations, and behavioral influences use JSON configuration files for game balance
- **Access-Based Preservation:** Frequently accessed memories decay slower, creating realistic reinforcement patterns
- **Automatic Summarization:** Old, low-relevance memories are automatically summarized to maintain performance

**Memory Entities:**
- **NPC Memories:** Personal experiences, interactions, observations
- **Faction Memories:** Collective organizational knowledge and history
- **Location Memories:** Environmental and historical data tied to specific places

**Memory Categories and Default Importance:**
- **Trauma:** 0.9 importance, 0.99 decay preservation (highly persistent)
- **Core Beliefs:** 0.8 importance, 0.98 decay preservation (fundamental values)
- **Achievements:** 0.7 importance, 0.96 decay preservation (personal accomplishments)
- **Relationships:** 0.6 importance, 0.97 decay preservation (social connections)
- **Economic:** 0.5 importance, 0.93 decay preservation (trade and financial events)

**Memory Decay System:**
All decay parameters are configured via `/data/systems/memory/behavioral_responses.json`:
- **Base Decay Rate:** Default 0.95 per time period
- **Category Modifiers:** Each memory category has specific preservation rates
- **Access Frequency Bonuses:** Memories accessed frequently decay 10-15% slower
- **Time Acceleration:** Older memories (30+ days) decay 20-50% faster
- **Importance Preservation:** Memories above 0.7 importance are protected from rapid decay

**Trust Calculation Framework:**
Trust between entities is calculated using weighted interaction history from `/data/systems/memory/trust_calculation.json`:
- **Interaction Weights:** Betrayal (-0.8), Help (+0.6), Promise Keeping (+0.7), etc.
- **Temporal Factors:** Recent interactions weighted more heavily with configurable decay
- **Emotional Modifiers:** Trauma amplifies negative interactions by 1.5x, joy amplifies positive by 1.2x
- **Relationship Baselines:** Different starting trust levels for strangers (0.5), friends (0.7), enemies (0.2)

**Behavioral Integration:**
- **Risk Assessment:** Past experiences inform danger evaluation for similar situations
- **Opportunity Recognition:** Pattern matching identifies beneficial scenarios
- **Emotional Triggers:** Traumatic or highly positive memories create behavioral modifiers
- **Faction Bias:** Collective memories influence political and diplomatic decisions

**Memory Storage Architecture:**
- **Primary Storage:** SQLAlchemy entities with JSONB fields for flexible metadata
- **Vector Database:** ChromaDB integration for semantic similarity search
- **Categorization Service:** Automatic content analysis for appropriate memory classification
- **Event Integration:** Memory creation/modification triggers events for other systems

**API Contracts:**

- **Deletion Thresholds:** Memories below 0.01 relevance are automatically removed
- **Memory Limits:** Maximum 50 memories considered for trust calculations
- **Access Tracking:** Frequently accessed memories are preserved longer

**Configuration Management:**
All memory system behavior is controlled via JSON files:
- `memory_categories.json` - Category definitions and default settings
- `trust_calculation.json` - Trust algorithm weights and modifiers
- `behavioral_responses.json` - Decay rates and influence calculations
- `emotional_triggers.json` - Emotional response mappings and intensities

**Integration Points:**
- **Faction System:** Collective memories influence diplomatic decisions and alliance formation
- **Economy System:** Trade fairness memories affect future commercial interactions
- **Combat System:** Battle experiences modify tactical behavior and risk assessment
- **Social System:** Relationship memories drive conversation topics and response styles

2. Quests can only be assigned if status is 'pending'
3. Quest prerequisites must be satisfied before assignment
4. Quest level should match player capabilities

### Quest Status Transitions
- `pending` → `active`, `abandoned`
- `active` → `completed`, `failed`, `abandoned`, `expired`
- `completed` → (terminal state)
- `failed` → `pending` (can retry)
- `abandoned` → `pending` (can retry)
- `expired` → `pending` (can retry)

### Quest Step Rules
1. Steps must be completed in order unless marked as non-required
2. Quest is complete when all required steps are finished
3. Optional steps can be skipped without affecting completion
4. Step metadata can store custom progress information

- **Medium**: 2-3 steps, moderate rewards, standard difficulty
- **Hard**: 3-4 steps, good rewards, challenging content
- **Epic**: 4-6 steps, excellent rewards, end-game content

### Reward Scaling
Rewards scale based on:
- Quest difficulty (base multiplier)
- Quest level (linear scaling)
- Location danger level
- Player level differential

## Theme System
