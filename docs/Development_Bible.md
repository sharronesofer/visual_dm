1. **All new code must be tested**: Any new feature or functionality added to the codebase must include comprehensive tests.
2. **Edge cases must be covered**: Tests should include edge cases, error conditions, and boundary values.
3. **Coverage isn't everything**: While we aim for high coverage percentages, the quality and thoroughness of tests are equally important.
4. **Keep tests maintainable**: Tests should be well-structured, documented, and easy to maintain.
5. **Integration tests**: In addition to unit tests, integration tests should be written for critical system interactions.

### Test Types

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions, methods, and classes in isolation.
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between different components or systems.
3. **Validation Tests**: Verify that data structures conform to expected schemas.
4. **Performance Tests**: Ensure that code performs efficiently under various loads.
5. **Edge Case Tests**: Test boundary conditions and error handling.

### Running and Reporting Tests

- Use pytest for running tests: `pytest -xvs path/to/tests`
- Generate coverage reports: `pytest --cov=backend path/to/tests`
- Update the test_coverage_summary.md file after significant test improvements

### Recent Improvements

- Increased data system test coverage from 58% to 85% by enhancing tests for data_file_loader.py, schema_validator.py, and biome_schema.py
- Established minimum coverage thresholds for all system components
- Implemented comprehensive test documentation standards

## Game Rules

**Summary:** This section provides the core mechanical rules for Visual DM as a tabletop roleplaying game system, with emphasis on differences from D&D 5e.

**Improvement Notes:** Consider adding examples of play and sample character sheets.

### Core Mechanics

#### Dice System
- Uses d20 for most resolution: roll d20 + attribute + skill vs. target number
- Critical success on natural 20, critical failure on natural 1 affects all rolls
- Advantage system: roll 2d20 and take highest (2Ã— advantage: roll 3d20 and take highest)
- Disadvantage system: roll 2d20 and take lowest (2Ã— disadvantage: roll 3d20 and take lowest)
- Skill checks: d20 + attribute + skill vs. Difficulty Class (DC)
- Contested checks: d20 + attribute + skill vs. opponent's d20 + attribute + skill

#### Character Attributes
- Six core attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma
- **Difference from D&D:** Attributes range from -3 to +5 directly (no separate modifier calculation)
- Characters start with all attributes at 0 and 12 points to distribute
- Point costs increase at higher levels: +3 to +4 costs 2 points, +4 to +5 costs 3 points
- Attributes can also be reduced to -3 to gain additional points

#### Skills
- Skills are tied to specific attributes and provide bonuses to related checks
- The canonical skill list includes:
  - **Appraise (INT):** Determine the value of items
  - **Balance (DEX):** Maintain footing on narrow or unstable surfaces
  - **Bluff (CHA):** Deceive others through words or actions
  - **Climb (STR):** Scale vertical surfaces
  - **Concentration (CON):** Maintain focus during distractions or while injured
  - **Craft (INT):** Create or repair items (subskills: Alchemy, Armorsmithing, Weaponsmithing, Trapmaking, Bowmaking)
  - **Decipher Script (INT):** Understand unfamiliar writing or codes
  - **Diplomacy (CHA):** Negotiate and persuade in good faith
  - **Disable Device (INT):** Disarm traps or sabotage mechanical devices

  - **Handle Animal (CHA):** Train and care for animals
  - **Heal (WIS):** Provide medical treatment
  - **Hide (DEX):** Conceal oneself from observation
  - **Intimidate (CHA):** Influence others through threats or fear
  - **Jump (STR):** Leap across gaps or over obstacles
  - **Knowledge (INT):** Specialized information in various fields (subskills: Arcana, Architecture and Engineering, Dungeoneering, Geography, History, Local, Nature, Nobility and Royalty, Religion, The Planes)
  - **Listen (WIS):** Notice sounds and conversations

#### Abilities (Feats)
- **Difference from D&D:** No classes or proficiency; character specialization comes entirely through ability selection
- Characters start with 7 abilities at level 1, then gain 3 additional abilities per level
- Abilities have prerequisites and form skill trees
- Abilities may grant skill bonuses, special actions, or unique capabilities
- The system allows for flexible character building, from specialists to generalists

### Health and Damage

#### Health Points (HP)
- Represent a character's vitality and ability to avoid serious injury
- Calculated based on abilities and Constitution attribute
- Temporary HP function as an additional buffer that is lost first

#### Wound System
- **Difference from D&D:** Characters who reach HP thresholds gain wound levels with penalties
- Wound levels: 
  - Unharmed (100-51% HP): No penalties
  - Bloodied (50-1% HP): -2 to all rolls
  - Wounded (0 HP): -5 to all rolls
  - Critically Wounded (negative HP): -10 to all rolls
  - Dead
- Recovery requires rest, medicine checks, or magical healing

#### Armor Class (AC) and Damage Reduction (DR)
- **Difference from D&D:** Both AC and DR exist and function differently
- AC: Determines if an attack hits (calculated as 10 + Dexterity + abilities + magic)
- DR: Reduces damage when hit (derived from armor, abilities, and some magic)
- DR is divided by damage type as detailed below

#### Damage Types
- **Physical:** Basic damage from weapons and physical attacks. Affected by physical DR from armor.
- **Magical:** Generic magical damage. Affected by magic resistance.
- **Fire:** Heat and flame damage. Affected by fire resistance, reduced by appropriate DR.
- **Ice:** Cold and frost damage. Affected by ice resistance, reduced by appropriate DR.
- **Lightning:** Electrical damage. Affected by lightning resistance, reduced by appropriate DR.
- **Poison:** Toxic damage. Affected by poison resistance, less affected by physical DR.
- **Psychic:** Mental damage. Generally not affected by physical DR, only by psychic resistance.
- **Necrotic:** Death energy and decay. Less affected by physical DR, reduced by necrotic resistance.
- **Radiant:** Holy or light-based damage. Less affected by physical DR, reduced by radiant resistance.
- **Force:** Pure magical energy. Affected by force resistance and some magical DR.
- **Acid:** Corrosive damage. Affected by acid resistance, can bypass some physical DR.
- **Thunder:** Sonic damage. Affected by thunder resistance, less affected by physical DR.
- **True:** Special damage that bypasses all resistances and DR.

### Combat

#### Initiative
- Roll d20 + Dexterity to determine turn order
- Initiative can be modified by weapon types and abilities

#### Combat Actions
- Each round, characters get:
  - 1 Action
  - 1 Bonus Action
  - 2 Free Actions
  - Movement (based on speed)
- Trigger actions (reactions) have a specific action cost (action, bonus, free, or movement)
- Trigger actions can only be used if you did not use the corresponding action type during your turn
- Standard actions include:
  - Attack: Roll to hit vs. target's AC
  - Cast Spell: Using magical abilities
  - Dodge: Increases AC until next turn
  - Dash: Double movement for the turn
  - Disengage: Move without provoking opportunity attacks
  - Hide: Make a Stealth check to become hidden
  - Help: Give advantage to an ally's next check
  - Ready: Prepare an action to trigger on a specific circumstance
- Additional combat actions include:
  - Feint: Contested Deception vs. Insight, success grants advantage on next attack
  - Assess: Insight check to identify enemy weaknesses or abilities
  - Intimidate: Contested Intimidation vs. Wisdom save to impose disadvantage

#### Attack Resolution
- Attacker rolls d20 + attack skill + attribute + ability modifiers
- Attack must equal or exceed target's AC to hit
- Critical hits (natural 20): Automatically hit and deal double damage
- Confirmed critical (nat 20 followed by a second hit roll): Double damage and ignore DR
- Double critical (nat 20 followed by another nat 20): [Note: Need to determine effect]
- Fumbles (natural 1): Negative consequence determined by the DM or AI

#### Weapon Categories
- **Difference from D&D:** Weapons are categorized as Heavy, Medium, or Light
- Heavy: Always two-handed
- Medium: Versatile (can be used one or two-handed)
- Light: One-handed
- Each category has associated abilities that grant "proficiency" or other benefits
- [Note: Need to reference feats.json for specifics on weapon proficiency implementation]

### Magic System

#### Mana Points
- **Major Difference from D&D:** Uses Mana Points (MP) instead of spell slots
- Characters have MP based on abilities and attributes
- Spell costs vary based on spell level and power
- MP regenerates fully after a long rest, and 50% after a short rest
- Some spells are "toggleable" and reduce maximum MP while active

#### Spellcasting
- Spell attack rolls: d20 + spell skill + attribute
- Spell save DC is typically the caster's skill score in the relevant domain
- Four magic domains: Nature, Arcane, Eldritch, Divine
- [Note: Concentration system needs to be fleshed out]

#### Spell Learning
- **Difference from D&D:** No spell preparation or ritual casting
- Spells are learned permanently through abilities
- No class restrictions on which spells can be learned

### Experience and Advancement

#### Experience Points (XP)
- Earned through combat, exploration, quest completion, and roleplaying
- **Difference from D&D:** No milestone leveling option; only XP tracking

#### Leveling
- Characters advance through levels by accumulating XP
- Each level provides 3 new abilities to purchase
- Abilities can only be purchased if prerequisites are met
- System encourages specialization or diversification based on player choice

### Rest and Recovery

#### Short Rest
- No specific time requirement (real-time game world)
- Recover 50% of HP and MP
- Can be taken twice between long rests
- [Note: Consider encounter chance during short rests]

#### Long Rest
- No specific time requirement (real-time game world)
- Recover all HP and MP
- Cannot be taken in dangerous locations
- Chance of dangerous encounter during rest based on region's Danger Level (DL)
- [Note: Need to create encounter tables for rest interruptions]

### Items and Equipment

#### Item Quality
- All items have some degree of magical properties
- Items have quality levels affecting their performance
- [Note: Reference existing item quality system documentation]

#### Encumbrance
- Characters can carry weight based on Strength attribute
- Penalties apply when carrying too much weight
- [Note: Need to define specific encumbrance thresholds and penalties]

#### Item Identification
- **Major Difference from D&D:** Progressive identification system
- Items reveal properties gradually through use or identification
- Identification methods:
  - Purchased identification services
  - Leveling up while using the item
  - Identify spell (if available)
- Items cannot be identified through ability checks

### Additional Mechanics

#### Critical Success/Failure Effects
- Critical successes (natural 20):
  - Attacks: Automatic hit and double damage
  - Skill checks/Saving throws: Automatic success regardless of DC
- Critical failures (natural 1):
  - Attacks: Miss plus potential negative consequences
  - Skill checks/Saving throws: Automatic failure plus potential complications
- AI may interpret critical success/failure with additional narrative consequences
