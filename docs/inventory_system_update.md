### Inventory System

**Summary:** Manages character inventories, item storage, weight calculations, and item categorization with configurable behavior and user-friendly sorting/filtering capabilities.

**Improvement Notes:** Add UI mockups for inventory interfaces.

The inventory system tracks items owned by characters, handling storage limitations, organization, and access. It manages encumbrance, categorization, and item interactions with a clean separation between business logic and infrastructure concerns.

#### Architecture & Organization

**Business Logic Layer (`/systems/inventory/`):**
- **Models:** Define inventory business entities and API request/response structures
- **Services:** Core business operations including inventory CRUD, pagination, and statistics
- **Configuration Management:** JSON-based externalized business rules and behavior

**Infrastructure Layer (`/infrastructure/systems/inventory/`):**
- **Database Entities:** SQLAlchemy models for data persistence
- **Repositories:** Data access layer (currently placeholder implementation)
- **Utilities:** Specialized operations for equipment, transfers, validation, and notifications

#### Key Features

**‚úÖ Working Components:**
- **Inventory Container Management:** Create, read, update, delete inventory containers
- **Configuration-Driven Behavior:** JSON-based rules for different inventory types
- **Status Management:** Configurable inventory statuses with transition rules
- **Pagination & Search:** Robust listing with filtering and search capabilities
- **Statistics Generation:** System-wide inventory analytics

**User-Facing Functionality:**
- **Inventory Sorting Options:**
  - By name (alphabetical)
  - By date added (newest first)
  - By value (highest first)
  - By weight (lightest first)
  - By rarity (rarest first)
  - By type (alphabetical)
  - By quest importance (for quest inventories)

- **Inventory Filtering Options:**
  - Filter by item type (weapon, armor, consumable, etc.)
  - Filter by rarity (common, rare, epic, legendary)
  - Filter by equipped status
  - Filter by item category
  - Filter by weight range
  - Filter by value range

#### Configuration System

**Inventory Types (`inventory_types.json`):**
```json
{
  "character": {
    "default_capacity": 50,
    "default_weight_limit": 100.0,
    "allows_trading": true,
    "allows_sorting": true,
    "allows_filtering": true,
    "default_sort": "name",
    "available_filters": ["type", "rarity", "equipped", "category", "weight"],
    "description": "Personal character inventory"
  },
  "shop": {
    "default_capacity": 200,
    "default_weight_limit": null,
    "allows_trading": true,
    "allows_sorting": true,
    "allows_filtering": true,
    "default_sort": "value",
    "available_filters": ["type", "rarity", "category", "value", "weight"],
    "description": "Merchant shop inventory"
  }
}
```

**Status Management (`inventory_statuses.json`):**
```json
{
  "active": {
    "description": "Inventory is available for use",
    "allows_operations": true,
    "visible_to_player": true,
    "can_transition_to": ["inactive", "maintenance", "archived"]
  },
  "maintenance": {
    "description": "Inventory is being updated or repaired",
    "allows_operations": false,
    "visible_to_player": false,
    "can_transition_to": ["active", "inactive"]
  }
}
```

**Business Rules (`inventory_rules.json`):**
- Pagination limits and defaults
- Validation rules for names, descriptions, and status values
- Sorting and filtering option definitions
- Operational timeouts and bulk operation limits

#### Integration Points & Dependencies

**‚úÖ Current Integration:**
- **Equipment System:** Uses inventory data for storing equippable items
- **Character System:** Each character owns an inventory when created
- **Loot System:** Adds generated items to character inventories
- **Economy System:** Handles item value calculations and trading

**‚è≥ Pending Implementation:**
- **Item Management:** Add/remove items within inventories (placeholder repositories)
- **Transfer Operations:** Move items between different inventories
- **Weight Validation:** Enforce capacity and weight limits
- **Event System:** Publish inventory change events for other systems

#### Recent Improvements (Fixed)

**üîß Bug Fixes:**
- ‚úÖ Fixed undefined variable references (`_inventory_id` ‚Üí `inventory_id`) in error messages
- ‚úÖ Corrected grammatical method naming (`list_inventorys` ‚Üí `list_inventories`)
- ‚úÖ Updated statistics field names for consistency

**üéØ Architecture Enhancements:**
- ‚úÖ Externalized business rules to JSON configuration files
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive configuration loader with caching
- ‚úÖ Implemented status transition validation
- ‚úÖ Added inventory type-specific behavior configuration

**üìã Configuration Benefits:**
- Non-developers can modify inventory behavior without code changes
- Different inventory types have distinct capabilities and defaults
- Status transitions are enforced through configuration rules
- Sorting and filtering options are easily customizable per inventory type

#### Next Development Priorities

1. **Item Management Implementation** - Replace placeholder repositories with functional item CRUD operations
2. **Capacity Validation** - Implement weight and slot limit enforcement
3. **Transfer System** - Build item transfer operations between inventories
4. **Event Integration** - Publish inventory change events for other systems to consume
5. **UI Integration** - Connect sorting/filtering capabilities to frontend interfaces

**üîß Maintenance Status:** **SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED**
- Critical runtime bugs fixed (undefined variable references)
- Business rules externalized for easier modification
- Clean architecture separation maintained
- Configuration-driven behavior enables easy customization
- Ready for item management implementation layer

The inventory system now provides a solid, configurable foundation for item storage with user-friendly sorting and filtering capabilities, proper error handling, and externalized business rules.
