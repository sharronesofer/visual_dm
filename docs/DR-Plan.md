# Disaster Recovery Plan (DR-Plan)

## Overview
This document outlines the disaster recovery (DR) strategy for the Visual DM platform, including backup, restore, and failover procedures for all critical data stores and services. It defines Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) for each component.

---

## 1. PostgreSQL Database
- **Backup**: Automated daily backups via Kubernetes CronJob using `pg_dump`, stored on persistent volume and replicated to off-site storage.
- **Restore**: Use the provided Kubernetes Job manifest to restore from the latest backup. Validate restore in a test environment before production use.
- **RTO**: 2 hours
- **RPO**: 24 hours
- **Runbook**:
  1. Identify latest backup file in `/backup` PVC.
  2. Update/launch `pg-restore` Job with correct backup file.
  3. Monitor job logs for completion/errors.
  4. Validate application functionality post-restore.

## 2. Redis
- **Backup**: Enable Redis snapshotting (RDB) and persist snapshots to PVC.
- **Restore**: Replace RDB file in PVC and restart Redis pod.
- **RTO**: 1 hour
- **RPO**: 1 hour
- **Runbook**:
  1. Copy backup RDB file to Redis PVC.
  2. Restart Redis deployment.
  3. Validate cache and session functionality.

## 3. Elasticsearch
- **Backup**: Use Elasticsearch snapshot API to save indices to persistent storage.
- **Restore**: Use snapshot API to restore indices.
- **RTO**: 4 hours
- **RPO**: 24 hours
- **Runbook**:
  1. Trigger snapshot restore via API or Kibana.
  2. Monitor restore progress in Elasticsearch logs.
  3. Validate search functionality.

## 4. Application Failover
- **Strategy**: Deploy standby instances in alternate availability zones or clusters. Use DNS or load balancer to redirect traffic.
- **Runbook**:
  1. Promote standby to primary.
  2. Update DNS/load balancer.
  3. Monitor system health.

## 5. Testing and Verification
- Schedule regular restore tests in a non-production environment.
- Monitor backup and restore job logs for errors.
- Document all incidents and lessons learned.
