# Inventory System Implementation

This document outlines the complete implementation of the inventory system as specified in the Development Bible.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Advanced Item Transfer
- **Multi-inventory Transfer**: Implemented bulk transfer of multiple items between inventories in a single transaction
- **Weight Validation**: Added comprehensive weight calculations and validations during transfers
- **Event Hooks**: Created an event emission system that fires events at key points in the transfer process
- **Atomic Transactions**: Ensured all inventory operations are wrapped in database transactions

### 2. Stack Management
- **Stackable Items**: Added support for stackable items with item-specific stack size limits
- **Stack Splitting**: Implemented functionality to split item stacks into multiple stacks
- **Stack Combining**: Added the ability to merge compatible item stacks
- **Stack Optimization**: Created utility to automatically organize and combine stacks in an inventory

### 3. Weight System
- **Weight Limits**: Added inventory weight limit validation
- **Equipped Item Weight**: Added configuration to control whether equipped items count toward weight limits
- **Weight Calculations**: Implemented utilities to calculate total inventory weight

### 4. Item Organization
- **Item Swapping**: Added support for swapping items between inventory slots
- **Position Management**: Implemented a system for managing the position of items in grid-based inventories
- **Custom Item Names**: Added support for custom-named items in inventories

### 5. Advanced Filtering
- **Multi-criteria Filtering**: Implemented comprehensive filtering system for inventory items
- **Property-based Filtering**: Added support for filtering by arbitrary item properties
- **Sorting Options**: Created options for sorting filtered results by various criteria

### 6. Equipment System
- **Equippable Items**: Enhanced the Item model to support equipment slots and equipping status
- **Equipment Validation**: Added validation for equipping items in appropriate slots

### 7. Event System
- **Event Emitters**: Created a comprehensive event system for inventory operations
- **Status Reporting**: Enhanced error reporting and status notification for inventory operations

### 8. Data Migration
- **Schema Updates**: Added migration scripts to update existing database schema
- **Data Defaults**: Provided intelligent defaults for new fields based on item categories

## API Endpoints

### Inventory Management
- `GET /inventories/{id}` - Get inventory details
- `POST /inventories` - Create a new inventory
- `PUT /inventories/{id}` - Update inventory properties
- `DELETE /inventories/{id}` - Delete an inventory

### Item Management
- `GET /inventories/{id}/items` - List items in an inventory
- `POST /inventories/{id}/items` - Add an item to an inventory
- `PUT /inventories/{id}/items/{item_id}` - Update an inventory item
- `DELETE /inventories/{id}/items/{item_id}` - Remove an item from an inventory

### Advanced Operations
- `POST /inventory/{from_id}/transfer/{to_id}/{item_id}` - Transfer a single item
- `POST /inventory/{from_id}/bulk-transfer/{to_id}` - Transfer multiple items in one operation
- `POST /inventories/{id}/filter` - Filter inventory items by various criteria
- `POST /inventories/{id}/swap` - Swap positions of two items
- `POST /inventories/{id}/split-stack/{stack_id}` - Split an item stack
- `POST /inventories/{id}/combine-stacks` - Combine two item stacks
- `POST /inventories/{id}/optimize-stacks` - Optimize stacks in an inventory
- `POST /admin/inventory/run-migrations` - Run inventory system migrations

## Future Enhancements

- Container items (items that contain other items)
- Item durability and condition tracking
- Item crafting and transformation
- Recipe-based inventory operations
- Enhanced inventory visualization tools
- Inventory permissions and access control

## Integration with Event System

The inventory system is fully integrated with the game's event-driven architecture, emitting events for all major operations:

- Item added/removed events
- Transfer started/completed/failed events
- Inventory weight limit exceeded events
- Stack splitting/combining events
- Equipment changed events

These events can be subscribed to by other systems, such as UI updates, quest triggers, achievement tracking, or economic systems.
