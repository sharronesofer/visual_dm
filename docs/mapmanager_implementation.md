# MapManager Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the enhancements made to the MapManager system to support a comprehensive map management solution for the Visual DM Unity game with FastAPI backend integration.

## Core Features Implemented

### 1. Map Creation and Persistence

The system now supports complete lifecycle management of map data:

- **Creating Maps**: The `CreateMap()` method allows creating new maps with proper ID generation, dimensions, and default properties.
- **Deleting Maps**: The `DeleteMap()` method properly removes maps and their associated annotations.
- **Serialization**: `SerializeMapToJson()` and `DeserializeMapFromJson()` enable converting map data to and from JSON format.
- **Persistence**: `SaveMapToFile()` and `LoadMapFromFile()` provide async methods for saving and loading maps from disk.
- **Map Discovery**: `GetAvailableMapFiles()` returns information about all maps stored in the maps directory.

### 2. Enhanced Layer Management

Comprehensive layer support has been implemented:

- **Layer CRUD**: Full layer management with `CreateMapLayer()`, `RemoveMapLayer()`, and `UpdateMapLayer()` methods.
- **Layer Ordering**: Support for reordering layers with `SetLayerOrder()`, `MoveLayerUp()`, and `MoveLayerDown()`.
- **Layer-Annotation Relationships**: `AssignAnnotationToLayer()` and `GetAnnotationsByLayer()` manage relationships between layers and annotations.
- **Layer Categorization**: `GetLayersByCategory()` organizes layers by their category property.

### 3. Enhanced Annotation Management

Advanced annotation capabilities now include:

- **Full Property Support**: `UpdateAnnotation()` supports modifying all annotation properties.
- **Batch Operations**: `CreateAnnotationsBatch()`, `RemoveAnnotationsBatch()`, and `UpdateAnnotationsBatch()` for efficient handling of multiple annotations.
- **Cross-Map Operations**: `CopyAnnotationsBetweenMaps()` and `MoveAnnotationsBetweenMaps()` enable transferring annotations between maps.
- **Advanced Filtering**: `FindAnnotations()` supports filtering by type, text search, custom properties, spatial area, layer, and visibility.

### 4. WebSocket Integration

Robust real-time synchronization has been implemented:

- **Entity Handlers**: Methods for handling remote updates to maps, layers, and annotations.
- **Event Forwarding**: Events for all remote operations to enable UI updates.
- **Update Loop Prevention**: Logic to prevent infinite update loops between local and remote changes.
- **Batch Operations**: Support for processing multiple remote changes efficiently.

## Implementation Details

### Initialization Flow

The MapManager now follows this initialization sequence:

1. `Awake()` sets up singletons, collections, and JSON serialization settings
2. `InitializeAsync()` loads maps from disk and selects an initial active map
3. WebSocket connections can be established after initialization is complete

### Data Structures

Additional data structures implemented:

- `MapSaveData`: Container for serializing map and annotation data together
- `MapFileInfo`: Information about map files on disk for map selection UI
- `MapAnnotationData`: Data structure for batch creation of annotations
- `MapAnnotationUpdateData`: Nullable properties for partial annotation updates
- `WebSocketSource`: Enum to track the source of remote updates

### Error Handling

The implementation includes robust error handling:

- All methods validate input parameters and object existence
- Detailed logging for debugging and troubleshooting
- Graceful handling of missing files, invalid data, and network failures

### Performance Considerations

The system has been designed with performance in mind:

- Batch operations to minimize update events
- Async I/O operations to prevent blocking the main thread
- Efficient lookups using dictionary-based indices
- Proper relationship tracking to avoid expensive searches

## Integration Points

The MapManager integrates with other systems through:

1. **Events**: Extensive event system for notifying UI components of changes
2. **WebSocket Handlers**: Methods to process updates from the backend
3. **Direct API**: Clean, well-documented methods for other systems to use

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future improvement:

1. Map version tracking and conflict resolution
2. Progressive loading for very large maps
3. Undo/redo support for map operations
4. Spatial indexing for more efficient annotation queries
5. Map data compression for storage and network optimization
