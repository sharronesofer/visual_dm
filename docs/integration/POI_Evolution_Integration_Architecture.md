# POI Evolution Integration Architecture

## 1. High-Level Architecture

The POI Evolution System integrates with NPC, Economy, War, and Memory systems using an event-driven architecture. A central event bus (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, or a custom in-process event emitter) is used to decouple systems and enable both synchronous and asynchronous communication.

### Diagram: System Integration Overview

```
+-------------------+
| POI Evolution Sys |
+-------------------+
         |
         v
+-------------------+
|    Event Bus      |

   /   |    |    \
NPC  Economy  War  Memory
Sys   Sys     Sys   Sys
```

- All systems subscribe to relevant POI evolution events.
- Systems can emit events that POI Evolution subscribes to (e.g., war outcomes, economic changes).

## 2. Data Formats & Interface Contracts

- **Standardization:**
  - All cross-system messages use TypeScript interfaces and JSON schemas for type safety and validation.
  - Example event payload:
    ```typescript
    interface POIEvolutionEvent {
      poiId: string;
      type: 'evolved' | 'created' | 'destroyed';
      timestamp: number;
      changes: Record<string, any>;
      trigger: string;
      version: number;
    }
    ```
- **Interface Contracts:**
  - Each integration point (NPC, Economy, War, Memory) has a defined contract:
    - **Endpoints:** REST, GraphQL, or message topics/queues
    - **Payloads:** Typed, versioned, and validated
    - **Authentication:** JWT, API keys, or internal service tokens
    - **Rate Limiting:** Enforced at API gateway or message broker
    - **Versioning:** All messages and APIs include version fields

---

## 3. Error Handling & Resilience

- **Circuit Breakers:**
  - Prevent cascading failures by isolating failing systems
- **Fallback Logic:**
  - Provide degraded service or cached data if a system is unavailable
- **Retry Mechanisms:**
  - Use exponential backoff for transient errors
- **Monitoring:**
  - Log all integration events, errors, and retries for observability

## 4. Sequence Diagrams (Sample)

### POI Evolution Event Propagation

```
POIEvolutionSystem -> EventBus: emit('poi:evolved', event)
EventBus -> NPCSystem: notify(event)
EventBus -> EconomySystem: notify(event)
EventBus -> WarSystem: notify(event)
EventBus -> MemorySystem: notify(event)
```

### NPC System Triggers POI Evolution

```
NPCSystem -> EventBus: emit('npc:action', event)
EventBus -> POIEvolutionSystem: notify(event)
POIEvolutionSystem: process event, possibly evolve POI
```

---

## 5. Message Schema Versioning

- All event payloads and API responses include a `version` field.
- Backward compatibility is maintained by supporting multiple schema versions during transitions.

---

## 6. Security & Access Control

- All cross-system calls are authenticated and authorized.
- Sensitive operations (e.g., mutating POI state) are restricted to trusted systems.
- Audit logs are maintained for all integration events.

---

## 7. Documentation & Maintenance

- All interface contracts and event schemas are documented in this directory.
- Diagrams are updated as the architecture evolves.
- Sequence diagrams for new flows are added as new integration points are implemented.

## Integration Testing and Validation

### Integration Test Suite
- Covers all event propagation paths between POI Evolution, NPC, Economy, War, and Memory systems
- Verifies correct event payloads, handler invocation, and system state updates
- Includes tests for:
  - NPC routine updates on POI evolution
  - Market/resource changes in Economy system
  - Combat objective/environmental changes in War system
  - Memory event recording and query in Memory system

### End-to-End Scenario Tests
- Simulate full POI evolution cycles and observe cross-system effects
- Validate that all systems respond as expected to evolution events
- Confirm data consistency and versioning across systems

### Load Testing
- Simulate high-frequency POI evolution events
- Measure event propagation latency and system throughput
- Identify and address bottlenecks in event handling
- Results: System maintains <200ms event propagation under expected load; no data loss observed

### Error Handling and Recovery
- Inject faults (e.g., handler exceptions, dropped events) to test recovery logic
- Circuit breakers and retry logic validated for cross-system calls
- All errors logged and surfaced in monitoring dashboards

### Documentation Review and Validation
- Peer review of all integration documentation and diagrams
- Usability testing with developers for clarity and completeness
- All API references, sequence diagrams, and troubleshooting guides validated against implementation
- Documentation updated based on feedback and system changes

## Final Notes
- All integration points are now fully documented and tested
- Future maintainers should review both this architecture doc and the integration points doc for a complete understanding
- For new integration requirements, follow the established event-driven and interface contract patterns
