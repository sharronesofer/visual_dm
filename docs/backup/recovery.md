# Recovery Procedures

## Introduction
Describe the purpose and scope of these recovery procedures, including objectives for restoring service and data integrity after a failure or disaster.

## Database Restoration
### Full Backup Restore
- Step-by-step instructions for restoring from a full backup created by `backup_full.sh`.
- Example command to decrypt, decompress, and restore using `psql`.
- Notes on required environment variables and permissions.

### Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)
- Steps for restoring using WAL/incremental backups.
- How to identify the target recovery point.
- Example commands for replaying WAL files.

### Verification
- How to verify the restored database (row counts, sample queries, checksums).

## File System Recovery
- Steps to restore files from rsync backup.
- Using the manifest file to verify completeness.
- Restoring permissions and metadata.
- Example rsync restore command.

## Application State Recovery
- Restoring configuration files and environment variables.
- Reapplying secrets (never store in VCS).
- Restarting services and verifying application health.

## Verification Steps
- Post-recovery validation: checksums, application-level tests, manual spot checks.
- Logging and reporting requirements.

## Recovery Time Objectives (RTO/RPO)
- Estimated recovery times for each scenario (database, file system, full stack).
- Recovery point objectives for data loss tolerance.

## Troubleshooting
- Common issues and solutions (e.g., permission errors, missing WAL files, incomplete restores).

## Revision History
- Track changes to recovery procedures and responsible authors.
