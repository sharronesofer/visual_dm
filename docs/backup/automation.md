# Backup Automation and Monitoring

## Overview
This document describes how to automate, monitor, and maintain the backup and recovery system.

## Cron Job Scheduling
- Example cron jobs for regular backups:

```cron
# Full database backup daily at 2am
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/scripts/backup && source config.env && ./backup_full.sh

# Incremental (WAL) backup every hour
0 * * * * cd /path/to/scripts/backup && source config.env && ./backup_incremental.sh

# File system backup nightly at 3am
0 3 * * * cd /path/to/scripts/backup && source config.env && ./backup_files.sh

# Prune old backups daily at 4am
0 4 * * * cd /path/to/scripts/backup && source config.env && ./prune_backups.sh

# Monitor backups every morning at 8am
0 8 * * * cd /path/to/scripts/backup && source config.env && ./monitor_backups.sh
```

- Adjust times and paths as needed for your environment.

## Monitoring
- `monitor_backups.sh` checks for recent backups, verifies integrity, and sends notifications on failure.
- Configure notification settings in `config.env` (email, Slack webhook).

## Pruning and Retention
- `prune_backups.sh` deletes old backups based on the retention policy set in `config.env`.

## Recovery Drills
- Schedule periodic recovery drills (e.g., monthly) to test restore procedures.
- Document results and lessons learned.

## Dashboard Integration (Optional)
- Integrate with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for backup status visualization.

## Security and Permissions
- Ensure cron jobs run as a user with appropriate permissions.
- Never store secrets in scripts or config files.

## Next Steps
- Review and customize cron jobs for your environment
- Test all automation and monitoring scripts
- Document any environment-specific adjustments
