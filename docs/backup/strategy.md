# Backup Strategy Document

## Introduction
Describe the purpose and scope of the backup strategy, including objectives for data protection, disaster recovery, and business continuity.

## Backup Types
- **Full Backup**: Complete copy of all data.
- **Incremental Backup**: Only data changed since the last backup.
- **Differential Backup**: Data changed since the last full backup.
- Use cases and rationale for each type.

## Backup Frequency
- **Database**: Daily full backups, hourly incremental backups.
- **File System**: Nightly full backups, with optional incremental for high-churn directories.
- Justification for chosen schedules.

## Retention Policies
- **Full Backups**: Retain for 30 days.
- **Incremental Backups**: Retain for 7 days.
- **Differential Backups**: Retain for 14 days.
- Policy for pruning old backups.

## Storage Locations
- **On-Premise**: Local NAS or SAN with redundancy.
- **Cloud Storage**: Encrypted S3 buckets or equivalent.
- **Redundancy**: At least two geographically separate locations.
- **Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit.

## Resource & Performance Considerations
- Estimate storage requirements for each backup type.
- Bandwidth planning for backup windows.
- Impact on system performance and mitigation strategies.

## Compliance & Security
- Encryption standards (e.g., AES-256).
- Access controls and audit logging.
- Regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

## Review & Approval
- Stakeholder review process.
- Document revision history.
