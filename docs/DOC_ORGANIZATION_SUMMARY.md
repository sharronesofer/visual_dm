# Documentation Organization Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the reorganization of documentation and utility files throughout the codebase. The goal was to improve organization by moving documentation files to more appropriate locations while keeping essential files in the root directory.

## Actions Completed

### Development Bible Migration

- **Moved the Development Bible** to the root directory for easy access:
  - Moved `docs/Development_Bible_Reorganized_Final.md` to `./development_bible.md`

### System Documentation Organization

- **Created a dedicated systems documentation directory** at `docs/systems/`:
  - Moved `# Custom TTRPG System Rules Reference.md` to `docs/systems/ttrpg_system_rules_reference.md`
  - Moved `POI_MEMORY_SYSTEM_v2.md` to `docs/systems/poi_memory_system_v2.md`
  - Moved `VisualDM_LootSystem_Roadmap.md` to `docs/systems/loot_system_roadmap.md`

### Refactoring Documentation Organization

- **Consolidated refactoring-related documentation** in `docs/refactoring/`:
  - Moved `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` to `docs/refactoring/migration_summary.md`
  - Moved `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md` to `docs/refactoring/refactoring_summary.md`
  - Moved `REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md` to `docs/refactoring/reorganization_summary.md`
  - Moved `VDM_REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md` to `docs/refactoring/vdm_reorganization_summary.md`
  - Moved `TEST_MIGRATION_README.md` to `docs/refactoring/test_migration_readme.md`

### Utility Scripts Organization

- **Moved remaining utility scripts to appropriate directories**:
  - Moved `run_migration.sh` to `scripts/testing/`
  - Moved `organize_docs.py` to `scripts/refactoring/`

### Files Kept in Root Directory

- Essential files were kept in the root directory:
  - `README.md` - Project overview and entry point
  - `requirements-dev.txt` - Development dependencies
  - `development_bible.md` - Central reference for project development standards

## Directory Structure

The reorganization has resulted in a cleaner, more organized directory structure:

```
/
├── README.md                      # Project overview
├── development_bible.md           # Central development reference
├── requirements-dev.txt           # Development dependencies
├── docs/
│   ├── systems/                   # System-specific documentation
│   │   ├── loot_system_roadmap.md
│   │   ├── poi_memory_system_v2.md
│   │   └── ttrpg_system_rules_reference.md
│   ├── refactoring/               # Refactoring documentation
│   │   ├── migration_summary.md
│   │   ├── refactoring_summary.md
│   │   ├── reorganization_summary.md
│   │   ├── test_migration_readme.md
│   │   └── vdm_reorganization_summary.md
│   └── ...                        # Other documentation
├── scripts/
│   ├── refactoring/               # Refactoring scripts
│   │   └── organize_docs.py       # Documentation organization script
│   ├── testing/                   # Testing scripts
│   │   └── run_migration.sh       # Test migration script
│   └── ...                        # Other scripts
└── ...
```

## Benefits

This organization provides several benefits:

1. **Cleaner Root Directory**: The root directory now contains only essential files, making it easier to navigate.
2. **Better Documentation Organization**: Documentation is now grouped by purpose and system, making it easier to find relevant information.
3. **Improved Discoverability**: Developers can more easily locate system-specific documentation and refactoring information.
4. **Central Development Reference**: The development bible is now in the root directory for immediate access.

## Next Steps

Consider these potential next steps to further improve documentation organization:

1. Create README files in each documentation subdirectory to explain the purpose and content.
2. Establish a consistent naming convention for documentation files.
3. Review and update cross-references between documentation files.
4. Consider implementing a documentation index or table of contents.
5. Review documentation for outdated content and update as needed.
