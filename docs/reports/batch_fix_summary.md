# Batch Fix Summary

## Fixed Issues

1. **Model Config Indentation Issues** - Fixed in schemas.py files
   - Fixed indentation in Pydantic model_config blocks
   - Moved example dicts into json_schema_extra

2. **Singleton Pattern Usage** - Fixed WorldStateManager instantiation
   - Changed direct instantiation to WorldStateManager.get_instance()
   - Ensured proper singleton pattern implementation

3. **SQLAlchemy Table Redefinition** - Added extend_existing=True to tables and models
   - Fixed user_roles_table and role_permissions_table
   - Added __table_args__ = {'extend_existing': True} to model classes

4. **Syntax Errors** - Fixed in multiple files
   - Fixed unmatched ']' and '}' errors
   - Corrected indentation and structure in various files
   - Fixed EMOTION_POOL and NPC_ROLE_LEVELS definitions

5. **Missing Import Errors** - Added proper imports
   - Added 'from typing import Dict, Any' in several files
   - Fixed missing imports in test files

6. **Missing Function Stubs** - Added stubs for combat system functions
   - Created stubs for StatusEffectType, apply_status_effect, etc.
   - Replaced stubs with proper imports from unified_combat_utils

7. **Missing Data Files** - Created placeholder data files
   - Added empty JSON files for equipment, effects, monsters, etc.

8. **Role Class Import Conflicts** - Fixed SQLAlchemy model conflicts
   - Changed imports to use fully qualified paths
   - Renamed imports to avoid naming conflicts
   - Updated __init__.py files to avoid duplicate imports

## Remaining Issues

1. **SQLAlchemy Model Initialization** - Some tests still fail due to model initialization errors
   - Role and User model tests still encounter "Multiple classes found for path" errors
   - Need to ensure all test files use consistent import patterns

2. **Auth Relationship Service** - KeyError: 'data' in relationship operations
   - Need to fix data structure in auth_relationships.py

3. **Mock Function Issues** - Test mocks not being called correctly
   - get_user_characters, get_character_users, and other mocks not being called

4. **Validation Logic Issues** - Several assertion failures in validation tests
   - Security service email validation failing
   - Password validation logic failing

5. **Expired JWT Token Tests** - Token expiry tests failing
   - Token expiry tests showing incorrect time calculations

## Statistics
- Starting failures: ~120
- Current passing: 75
- Current failing: 30
- Current errors: 20
- Skipped tests: 24

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Create a DatabaseFixScript that adds extend_existing=True to all model classes
2. Fix auth_relationships.py to update relationship data structure
3. Update validation functions in auth_service.py and security_service.py
4. Fix token expiry calculation in token_service.py
5. Review and fix mock function calls in test files
