## 📊 **REFACTORING STATISTICS**

| Status | Count | Total Lines | Percentage |
|--------|-------|-------------|------------|
| ✅ **Completed** | 3 systems | ~6,800 lines | **26%** |
| 🔄 **Remaining** | 15 files | ~20,000+ lines | **74%** |

### **Impact Analysis:**
- **High Impact Remaining:** 6 files (>1500 lines each)
- **Medium Impact Remaining:** 9 files (1000-1500 lines each)
- **Total Refactoring Scope:** ~26,800 lines across 18 files

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS**

### **Immediate Priorities (Next Session):**
1. **motif/consolidated_manager.py** (2,104 lines) - Highest impact
2. **analytics/services/analytics_service.py** (2,004 lines) - Second highest
3. **character/services/character_service.py** (1,945 lines) - Core system

### **Refactoring Strategy:**
1. **Follow Established Pattern:** Use same facade + modular approach as combat/diplomacy
2. **Archive Originals:** Move to `archives/monolithic_files/`
3. **Maintain Compatibility:** 100% backward compatibility through facades
4. **Test Coverage:** Ensure refactored modules maintain test coverage

### **Template Architecture:**
```
backend/systems/<system>/
├── managers/           # Core orchestration
├── processors/         # Specialized processing
├── handlers/          # Specific operations
├── <system>_facade.py # Backward compatibility
└── services/          # Business logic
```
