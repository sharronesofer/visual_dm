## Recommendations

Based on the analysis above, here are the recommended consolidation actions:

1. For files that are identical (100% similarity), keep only one copy in the more appropriate module.
2. For files with high similarity (>70%), merge functionality into one consolidated version.
3. For files with common method names but different implementations, review each to determine the better implementation.
4. Consider standardizing on singular module names (e.g., 'Faction' instead of 'Factions').
