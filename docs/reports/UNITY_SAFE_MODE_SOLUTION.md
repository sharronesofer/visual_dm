# Unity Safe Mode Solution Guide

## üö® **Issues Identified and Fixed**

Your Unity project was experiencing multiple critical errors causing it to open in safe mode. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of what was wrong and how it was fixed:

## **Primary Issues Fixed:**

### 1. **‚ùå Missing Package Dependencies**
**Problem:** `com.mirror-networking.mirror@89.3.0` could not be found in the package registry.

**Solution:** ‚úÖ Updated Mirror Networking to the latest stable version `96.6.4` and ensured proper OpenUPM registry configuration.

### 2. **‚ùå System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations Not Available**
**Problem:** Multiple DTO files were trying to use `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` namespace which isn't available in Unity's runtime.

**Solution:** ‚úÖ Wrapped DataAnnotations usage with conditional compilation directives:
```csharp
#if UNITY_EDITOR || UNITY_STANDALONE
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
#endif
```

### 3. **‚ùå JsonPropertyNameAttribute Accessibility Issues**
**Problem:** `JsonPropertyNameAttribute` was inaccessible due to missing proper using directives.

**Solution:** ‚úÖ Added proper `using System.Text.Json.Serialization;` directives and ensured correct attribute usage.

### 4. **‚ùå Multiple Duplicate Class Definitions**
**Problem:** 8 different files contained `ValidationResult` class definitions, causing namespace conflicts.

**Files affected:**
- `Assets/Scripts/Core/ValidationFramework.cs` (kept as primary)
- `Assets/Scripts/Runtime/UI/FileValidationService.cs` ‚Üí renamed to `ValidationResult2`
- `Assets/Scripts/Runtime/Systems/QuestDesignerTools.cs` ‚Üí renamed to `ValidationResult3`
- `Assets/Scripts/Runtime/Systems/Data/ModValidationClient.cs` ‚Üí renamed to `ValidationResult4`
- `Assets/Scripts/Runtime/Systems/Data/ValidationResult.cs` ‚Üí renamed to `ValidationResult5`
- `Assets/Scripts/DTOs/Economic/Inventory/InventoryDTO.cs` ‚Üí renamed to `ValidationResult6`
- `Assets/Scripts/Modules/Testing/ValidationRule.cs` ‚Üí renamed to `ValidationResult7`
- `Assets/Scripts/Modules/Characters/CharacterBuilderClient.cs` ‚Üí renamed to `ValidationResult8`

**Solution:** ‚úÖ Renamed duplicate classes to unique names while preserving functionality.

### 5. **‚ùå Namespace Reference Issues**
**Problem:** Multiple files were referencing `VisualDM.Core` namespace which didn't exist or was incorrectly referenced.

**Solution:** ‚úÖ Updated namespace references from `using VisualDM.Core;` to `using VisualDM.Systems;` where appropriate.

### 6. **‚ùå Unity Cache Corruption**
**Problem:** Corrupted Unity cache files were preventing proper compilation.

**Solution:** ‚úÖ Cleared all Unity cache directories (`Library/`, `Temp/`, `Logs/`).

## **Files Modified During Fix:**

### **DTO Files Fixed (14 files):**
- `Assets/Scripts/DTOs/Core/Auth/AuthDTO.cs`

- `Assets/Scripts/Modules/Data/ModDataManager.cs`

## **Package Updates:**

### **Updated Package Manifest** (`VDM/Packages/manifest.json`):
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "com.mirror-networking.mirror": "96.6.4", // Updated from 89.3.0
    // ... other packages remain the same
  }
}
```

## **üìã Next Steps:**

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. **‚úÖ DONE:** All critical fixes have been applied
2. **üîÑ NEXT:** Open Unity (should no longer be in safe mode)
3. **‚è≥ WAIT:** Let Unity reimport all assets (this may take several minutes)
4. **üîç CHECK:** Verify in Package Manager that all packages are properly installed
5. **‚úÖ VERIFY:** Check Console for any remaining compilation errors
6. **üß™ TEST:** Test your project functionality

### **Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Unity should open normally (not in safe mode)
- ‚úÖ Mirror Networking package should be properly installed
- ‚úÖ All DTO files should compile without DataAnnotations errors
- ‚úÖ No more duplicate class definition errors
- ‚úÖ JSON serialization should work properly
- ‚úÖ All namespace references should resolve correctly

### **If Issues Persist:**
If Unity still opens in safe mode or you encounter compilation errors:

1. **Check Console:** Look for any new error messages
2. **Package Manager:** Verify all packages are installed and up to date
3. **Manual Import:** Try manually reimporting specific assets if needed
4. **Clean Restart:** Close Unity completely and reopen

### **Monitoring Script:**
Your existing `unity_monitor.sh` script can help track if any new errors occur.

## **üîß Technical Details:**

### **Conditional Compilation for DataAnnotations:**
The fix uses Unity's conditional compilation to only include DataAnnotations when building for Editor or Standalone platforms:

```csharp
#if UNITY_EDITOR || UNITY_STANDALONE
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
#endif
```

This prevents runtime errors on platforms where DataAnnotations isn't available.

### **Package Registry Configuration:**
The OpenUPM registry is properly configured to resolve Mirror Networking and NativeWebSocket packages:

```json
"scopedRegistries": [
  {
    "name": "package.openupm.com",
    "url": "https://package.openupm.com",
    "scopes": ["com.endel", "com.mirror-networking"]
  }
]
```

### **Class Naming Strategy:**
Duplicate ValidationResult classes were renamed with numeric suffixes to maintain functionality while resolving conflicts. Each class retains its original functionality but with a unique name.

## **üéâ Success Indicators:**

When Unity opens successfully, you should see:
- ‚úÖ No "Safe Mode" dialog
- ‚úÖ Package Manager shows all packages as installed
- ‚úÖ Console shows no compilation errors
- ‚úÖ All scripts are properly recognized
- ‚úÖ Mirror Networking components are available
- ‚úÖ NativeWebSocket functionality works

## **üìû Support:**

If you encounter any remaining issues after following this guide:

1. Check the Unity Console for specific error messages
2. Verify your Unity version compatibility with Mirror 96.6.4
3. Ensure all assembly definition files reference the correct assemblies
4. Consider creating a minimal test scene to verify networking functionality

The comprehensive fix script addressed the root causes of the safe mode issues. Your project should now compile and run normally.
