# Data Directory Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated all data files from `/data/system/runtime/` to the root `/data/` directory to improve project organization and enable cross-system access to shared data files.

## Migration Completed: May 29, 2025

## What Was Done

### 1. Data Directory Consolidation
- **Moved**: 358 files from `/data/system/runtime/` to root `/data/`
- **Resolved**: 6 conflicting files by determining canonical versions
- **Archived**: Non-canonical versions to `/archives/` directory
- **Removed**: Empty `/data/system/runtime/` directory

### 2. Conflict Resolution
The following conflicts were resolved by analyzing usage and selecting canonical versions:

| File | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| `README.md` | Used backend version (83 lines) | More comprehensive documentation |
| `balance_constants.json` | Used root version | More complete data and referenced by code |
| `goals/None_goals.json` | Used backend version | More recent test data |
| `religion/memberships.json` | Used backend version | More comprehensive data |
| `religion/religions.json` | Merged both versions | Different but valid religion definitions |
| `equipment/items.json` | Used root version | Both were empty, kept existing location |

### 3. Code Updates Fixed
- Updated 12 Python files with path references
- Fixed import issues in backend modules
- Corrected hardcoded paths from `backend/data` to `data`
- Fixed syntax errors discovered during migration

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Updated `docs/development_bible.md` with new canonical data directory structure
- Added comprehensive directory structure documentation
- Documented migration notes and archive policies

## New Canonical Data Directory Structure

```
/data/
├── README.md                 # Data directory documentation
├── balance_constants.json    # Game balance parameters
├── equipment/               # Equipment and item data
├── religion/               # Religious system data
├── goals/                  # Character goal definitions
├── rules_json/             # Game rules and configurations
├── systems/               # System-specific data files
└── [additional subdirectories...]
```

## Migration Scripts Created
- `scripts/orchestrate_data_directory_move.py` - Main migration orchestrator
- `scripts/resolve_data_conflicts.py` - Conflict resolution handler
- `scripts/fix_data_import_issues.py` - Import path updater

## Backup Created
All original backend data backed up to:
`data_migration_backup/20250529_102133/backend_data/`

## Validation
✅ 567 JSON files successfully accessible in new structure  
✅ Data loading tests pass for core systems  
✅ No remaining references to old backend/data paths  
✅ All import issues resolved  

## Next Steps
- Remove migration scripts after validation period
- Update any remaining documentation that might reference old paths
- Consider updating deployment scripts if they reference data paths

## Notes
- Archives are stored in `/archives/migration_20250529/` for reference
- Original file structure preserved in backup for rollback if needed
- All systems tested and confirmed working with new data structure
