# 2024 System Design Clarifications and Decisions

## Region/City/Metropolis

**Q: Can cities/POIs be abandoned, ruined, or transformed?**
A: Yes. If a city is depopulated, it becomes a 'city' POI but changes from 'social' to 'combat' or 'neutral' (e.g., ruins, dungeons). Dungeon/exploration POIs can become 'social' if repopulated. Implement POI state transitions and NPC (re)generation logic for dynamic world repopulation.

**Q: Do regions have biome/environmental tags that influence generation?**
A: Yes. Regions use biome/environmental tags from 'land_types.json' to influence city/POI generation, motif assignment, and arc types. Ensure 'land_types.json' exists and is referenced in generation logic.

**Q: Should there be reserved POI slots for future systems?**
A: Not currently, but initial procgen should scaffold for future reserved slots (e.g., religious centers, embassies). Add reserved POI slot logic to initial world/region generation.

## Motif System

**Q: Can motifs be locked or prevented from rotating out?**
A: No. Motifs are never locked; always fluid and rotate by duration.

**Q: Is there a need for a global motif?**
A: Yes. A single 'world motif' (max intensity, lasts a month) can exist. Add support for a global motif affecting all regions/NPCs.

**Q: Should motif history be tracked?**
A: No. Remove motif history tracking.

## Memory System

**Q: Are core memories shareable or transferrable?**
A: No. Core memories are always entity-local. Sharing only occurs via dialogue/GPT, not direct transfer.

**Q: Should certain memories be pinned for narrative importance?**
A: Leave to GPT/LLM logic; no explicit 'pinning' system.

## Arc/Quest System

**Q: Can arcs span multiple regions or be global?**
A: Yes. Multi-region arcs and global arcs (world events) are possible. Scaffold for global arcs/world events and consider how arcs can span multiple regions.

**Q: Should arcs have dependencies?**
A: No explicit dependencies; left to GPT/narrative logic.

## Faction System

**Q: Should there be a system for faction schisms?**
A: Yes. Design logic for faction schisms (e.g., based on tension, ideology, or events).

**Q: Can rumors escalate into core memories or world events?**
A: No. Rumors never become core memories or world events.

## Tension/War System

**Q: Can tension go negative (alliances)?**
A: Yes. Allow tension to go as low as -100 for alliances/trust, decaying over time like positive tension.

**Q: Should war outcomes have mechanical consequences?**
A: Open to suggestions for mechanical consequences (e.g., resource changes, population shifts). Propose and implement mechanical effects for war outcomes.

## Rumor/Truth System

**Q: Should rumors mutate as they spread?**
A: Yes. Add/ensure rumor mutation logic (e.g., GPT prompt to vary rumor text on spread).

**Q: Are legendary rumors needed?**
A: No. Memory/core memory handles this.

## Event Hooks/Integration

**Q: Should there be a formal event bus/dispatcher?**
A: Prefer to have a dispatcher for custom event crafting/injection. Scaffold a central event dispatcher for narrative/mechanical events.

**Q: Should all major events be logged for analytics/AI training?**
A: Yes. Ensure analytics hooks are present and data is structured for LLM consumption.

## Planned/Future Systems

**Q: How should religion be handled?**
A: Religion should cross faction barriers, be narrative-driven, and sometimes overlap with factions. New factions may sometimes be religions. Scaffold a religion system with cross-faction membership and narrative hooks.

**Q: How should diplomacy/politics be handled?**
A: Formal negotiation, treaties, and diplomatic events should exist and integrate with faction logic. Scaffold diplomacy system and integrate with factions.

**Q: Should other systems (economy, magic, technology) be scaffolded now?**
A: Economy should already have a scaffold; check and add if missing. Magic: no new system needed beyond current implications. Technology: not needed now, but keep in mind for region/faction types.

# Additional Q&A and Clarifications (Latest)

- The original primary capitol is a historical note; all previous capitols can be stored as core regional memories. The capitol of a region never changes, regardless of population.
- Metropolis types to use: Arcane, Industrial, Sacred, Ruined, Natural. Logic for assigning these types should be added now.
- All 3 motifs in a region's pool must be unique. Motifs are not locked and rotate out when their duration expires. Each motif has an "intensity" and "duration" (total 7 points, e.g., intensity 6 = 1 week duration).
- Arc failure should be recorded as a core memory or special event in the region's history. Arcs must always resolve/fail before a new one starts, but unrelated events can happen during an arc.
- Tension is capped (e.g., 0–100); war breaks out at a certain threshold. War duration may be a countdown that resets on city capture. Global tension events are possible via the CHAOS system.
- Minimum affinity is required to join a faction; affinity is 0–100, and each point is a % chance to join per day. For switching, the chance is Faction1affinity - Faction2affinity %.
- NPCs may be able to belong to multiple factions (e.g., spies, diplomats); logic should be built for this if allowed.
- Rumors have a robust system; they cannot be proven or converted into core memories, as they are based on NPC memories.
- Each system (core memories, motif changes, tension updates) handles its own event hooks. All major system changes (capitol change, arc failure, tension spike) should be logged in a central world history for analytics or narrative purposes.
- All these systems are hidden from the player; they are narrative-driven and not directly manipulable.

**Meta Note:**
- Can you look in zip files or no? (AI: I cannot directly search inside zip files unless they are extracted to the filesystem. If you want to search inside a zip, please extract it first.)

# Open Design Decisions and Clarifications (2024-)

## Narrative Hooks/Extensibility

**Q: Should there be a standardized way for new/future systems (e.g., economy, religion, diplomacy) to hook into memory/motif/arc logging?**
A: None of these need to hook *into* motifs, but motifs might influence them. Anywhere a GPT is called, motifs should probably be involved. Religion is not yet implemented but should be. For now, new systems do not hook directly into motifs/memory/arcs except via GPT context. If you want to add more hooks, that's fine. A central event bus/dispatcher is not required but could be added if needed.

## Player Visibility

**Q: Should any of these systems (motifs, core memories, arc status) ever be partially visible to the player, or are they always fully hidden?**
A: They are always fully hidden. All are narrative-driven and not directly manipulable or visible to the player.

## Motif System

**Q: Should motif decay rate or duration ever be influenced by world events, or always fixed by intensity?**
A: Always fixed by intensity. Motifs are purely narrative and only influence GPT behavior, not other systems.

**Q: Are there narrative consequences for certain motif combinations, or is this left to GPT/narrative logic?**
A: No specific consequences. This is left entirely to GPT/narrative logic.

## Memory System

**Q: Should core memories be categorized (e.g., "war", "politics", "arc", "catastrophe") for easier querying/analytics, or is this left to GPT/narrative logic?**
A: Might as well categorize them. "More is more." No strong opinion, but categories can be added for analytics.

**Q: Should GPT summarization be tunable (e.g., more/less detail, different narrative styles)?**
A: Yes. The plan is to build custom LLMs for this, possibly multiple models for different styles/levels of detail.

## Faction System

**Q: Should there ever be a cost or cooldown for switching factions, or is it always affinity-based and immediate?**
A: Always affinity-based and immediate, but with some influence logic (e.g., you can't switch if you're a well-known member and the other faction hates you). Add logic as needed.

**Q: Should rumor decay be fixed, or can it be event-driven/tunable?**
A: Probably fixed. Decay happens naturally as memories move and mutate. If a rumor is repeated often, it won't decay. The system is designed to mimic real life.

## Technical/Integration

**Q: Should there be a central event bus/dispatcher for all narrative/mechanical events, or is the current event hook system sufficient?**
A: Either is fine. A central event bus could be added, but the current event hook system is sufficient for now. Use your best judgment.

**Q: Are there any planned future systems that will need reserved integration points?**
A: Diplomacy/politics and religion are planned but not yet implemented. More systems may be added in the future, so keep extensibility in mind.

## Technical Implementation Decisions Q&A (2024)

The following Q&A provides industry best practice solutions for key technical systems requiring implementation in the Visual DM codebase.

### Event System Implementation

**Q: What architecture should we use for implementing the central event dispatcher?**

**A:** The central event dispatcher will use an Event Bus pattern with a publish-subscribe model. This provides loose coupling between components and flexibility for future extensions. Key features of the implementation include:

1. A singleton `EventDispatcher` class that maintains subscriptions
2. Support for typed events via Pydantic BaseModel
3. Async event handling with prioritization
4. Middleware chain for logging, filtering, and other cross-cutting concerns
5. Both async and sync interfaces for various contexts
6. Thread-safe operation for concurrent event handling

The design allows for easy addition of new event types and subscribers without modifying existing code, following the Open/Closed Principle. Events are strongly typed for better maintainability and type safety.

### Analytics Service Implementation

**Q: How should we structure the analytics service for event capture and analysis?**

**A:** The analytics service will be implemented as a singleton with an event-driven architecture that integrates with the central event dispatcher. Key aspects include:

1. A dedicated `AnalyticsService` class that registers middleware with the event dispatcher
2. Structured event storage using JSON files organized by date and category
3. Configurable storage paths and retention policies
4. Automatic metadata enrichment (timestamps, session IDs, etc.)
5. Support for aggregation and filtering for analysis
6. LLM training dataset generation capabilities
7. Both async and sync interfaces

This approach allows non-intrusive analytics collection that doesn't impact core gameplay, while maintaining a structured format for later analysis and model training.

### Memory System Implementation

**Q: How should we design the memory system for storing and retrieving entity memories?**

**A:** The memory system will be implemented using a repository pattern with relevance scoring and decay. Key features include:

1. A singleton `MemoryManager` class for central memory operations
2. `Memory` objects with metadata, categories, relevance scores
3. Support for "core memories" that don't decay over time
4. Contextual relationships between memories (memory graphs)
5. Event emission for memory operations via the event dispatcher
6. Persistence with JSON storage organized by entity
7. Memory decay mechanisms to simulate forgetting
8. Methods for generating memory summaries for LLM context

This design provides a scalable, flexible memory system that simulates realistic memory patterns while maintaining good performance and integration with other systems.

### Rumor System Implementation

**Q: What's the best approach for implementing the rumor creation and propagation system?**

**A:** The rumor system will be implemented using a variant of the Information Diffusion model with mutations. Key design elements include:

1. A singleton `RumorSystem` class for managing rumor operations
2. `Rumor` objects with truth values, severity, and categories
3. Support for rumor variants/mutations as they spread
4. Entity-specific believability tracking
5. Natural mutation capabilities via configurable handlers
6. Persistence with JSON storage organized by rumor ID
7. Integration with event system for rumor events
8. Believability calculations based on entity relationships and bias

This approach allows realistic rumor propagation with mutations while maintaining traceability of how information spreads and changes throughout the world.

### World State Implementation

**Q: How should we implement the world state system with historical tracking?**

**A:** The world state system will be implemented using a key-value store with temporal versioning. Key aspects include:

1. A singleton `WorldStateManager` class with hierarchical state organization
2. Support for categorization, regions, and tagging of state variables
3. Complete history tracking of all state changes
4. Query capabilities by category, region, time period, and prefix
5. Event emission for state changes via event dispatcher
6. Persistence with JSON storage and automatic saving
7. Historical state reconstruction at any point in time
8. Thread-safe operations for concurrent access

This design provides a flexible foundation for tracking world state with full history, enabling features like state rollback, historical queries, and change analysis.

### Time System Implementation

**Q: How should we design the time system with calendar support and scheduled events?**

**A:** The time system will be implemented as a discrete-time simulation with variable time scaling. Key features include:

1. A singleton `TimeManager` class for central time management
2. Support for different time units (tick, minute, hour, day, etc.)
3. Variable time progression speeds (paused, slow, normal, fast)
4. Calendar system with seasons, months, years, and eras
5. Event scheduling at specific game times
6. Recurring events with configurable intervals
7. Event emission for time changes via event dispatcher
8. Time-based conditions (day/night, seasons, etc.)
9. Persistence with JSON storage for time state and scheduled events

This approach provides a flexible time system that can run at various speeds, supports scheduling, and integrates with other game systems through the event dispatcher.

### Population Control System Implementation

**Q: How should we implement NPC population control for POIs?**

**A:** The population control system will be implemented using a percentage-based birth rate model that can be manually adjusted. Key features include:

1. A `PopulationManager` class for centralized population control
2. Configurable base birth rates for each POI type
3. Population calculation formula:
   - Monthly NPC generation = Base Rate × (Current Population ÷ Target Population) × Global Multiplier
4. Adjustment mechanisms:
   - Admin controls for manual birth rate adjustment
   - Global multiplier for system-wide population control
   - Negative multipliers for population reduction
5. Population thresholds:
   - Soft cap (reduced birth rate) at 90% of maximum
   - Hard cap at defined maximum per POI type
   - Minimum threshold to prevent ghost towns
6. Integration with:
   - POI state transition system
   - Resource consumption mechanics
   - Faction influence calculations
   - Event system for population changes

This system ensures realistic population dynamics while providing manual control levers to adjust NPC numbers if they become too populous or too sparse across the game world.

### World Motif System Implementation

**Q: How should we implement the global and regional motif systems?**

**A:** The motif system will be implemented using a randomized rotation model with synthesis between overlapping motifs. Key features include:

1. A `MotifManager` class for centralized motif management
2. Global motif implementation:
   - Single global motif active at any time
   - Fixed duration of 28 days ± 10 days (randomly determined)
   - Always at maximum intensity (7)
   - Stronger than any individual regional motifs (which cap at 6)
   - Selected completely at random from predefined list
3. Regional motif implementation:
   - Lower-order motifs with variable durations based on intensity
   - Multiple regional motifs can coexist
   - No conflicting motifs (only synthesis between motifs)
   - Duration proportional to intensity for regional motifs
4. Motif effects implementation:
   - Influence on NPC behavior and dialogue via GPT context
   - Influence on random event generation
   - Influence on relationship development rates
   - Influence on story arc development
5. Integration with:
   - Event system for motif changes
   - Time system for duration tracking
   - NPC and region systems for applying effects

This implementation follows the design decisions that motifs are randomly selected, never influenced by other factors, have no conflicts (only synthesis), and that global motifs maintain a fixed duration with maximum strength while regional motifs have variable durations based on intensity.

## Pending Architectural Decisions

The following architectural questions or decisions remain unresolved and require further discussion or action before play-testing. This list was compiled via a comprehensive gap analysis of all ADRs, technical requirements (see `undocumented_requirements.md`), feature prioritization summaries, and supporting diagrams. Items are prioritized by criticality for play-testing and cross-referenced with source documents. High-priority items are highlighted for immediate follow-up.

| Pending ID | Question/Problem | Why Unresolved | Options Considered | Dependencies | Impact if Unresolved | Timeline | Priority |
|------------|------------------|---------------|--------------------|--------------|---------------------|----------|----------|
| P-001 | Input handling extensibility for new device types (e.g., VR, future controllers) | Current implementation supports keyboard/controller/touch, but lacks abstraction for future device integration | 1. Abstract input layer now; 2. Defer until new device needed | IR-001, InputHandler module | May block accessibility or future platform support | Before play-testing on new platforms | High |
| P-002 | Multi-step/chained interaction logic and conditional flows | Design for multi-step/conditional interactions not finalized; unclear how to represent in state and UI | 1. State machine per interaction; 2. Scripting system; 3. Hardcoded logic | IR-003, InteractionManager, UI | Limits complex gameplay scenarios, may block advanced play-testing | Prototype before advanced play-testing | High |
| P-003 | Edge case feedback (overlapping interactables, multiplayer, progression resets) | Edge case handling logic not fully specified; UI/UX for feedback not finalized | 1. Contextual UI overlays; 2. Event log; 3. Minimal feedback | IR-005, UI, EventBus | May cause confusion or missed interactions during play-testing | Before multiplayer/edge-case play-tests | High |
| P-004 | Profiling and optimization for large numbers of interactables | Profiling tools and optimization strategies not fully integrated; performance under load untested | 1. Integrate profiling tools now; 2. Optimize reactively | IR-006, EventBus, InteractionManager | Risk of poor performance/scalability in large scenes | Before large-scale play-testing | High |
| P-005 | Standardized error codes/messages and separation of user/system logs | Error handling framework partially implemented; not all APIs/events use standard codes | 1. Enforce standardization now; 2. Gradual migration | IR-007, Error Handling, Logging | Inconsistent error reporting, harder debugging | Before public play-testing | Medium |
| P-006 | Event-driven architecture for state changes: async safety and transaction boundaries | EventBus async safety and transactionality not fully validated; risk of race conditions | 1. Add transactional event wrappers; 2. Accept eventual consistency | IR-008, EventBus, StateController | Potential for state desync or bugs in edge cases | Before integration with other systems | High |

# Party vs. Guild Organization: Codebase Separation

## Overview
This document explains the architectural separation between party and guild systems in the codebase, as part of the audit for Task 493 (Party Disbanding Trigger Audit and Documentation).

---

## Party System
- **Location:** `backend/core/systems/party/PartyManager.ts`, `backend/core/systems/party/types.ts`
- **Key Class:** `PartyManager`
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Manages party lifecycle: creation, joining, leaving, kicking, disbanding, and state transitions.
  - Handles party membership, invitations, roles, and party-specific events.
  - Implements distributed locking for concurrency control.
  - All party logic (including disbanding) is encapsulated in the `PartyManager` class and related types.
- **Persistence:**
  - Parties are managed in-memory and via Redis for distributed locking.
  - No overlap with guild persistence or logic.

## Guild System
- **Location:** `src/poi/models/SocialPOI.ts`, `utils/buildingFactory.ts`, `types/buildings/social.ts`
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Guilds are modeled as a subtype of social points of interest (POIs), specifically as `SocialSubtype.GUILD`.
  - Guild buildings are created via `createGuildHall` in `utils/buildingFactory.ts`.
  - Guilds have their own NPCs, quests, and faction logic, managed within the `SocialPOI` class.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Guilds are persistent world organizations, not tied to transient player parties.
  - Guild logic includes NPC roles (e.g., guildmaster, trainer), quest availability, and faction reputation.
  - No direct overlap with party membership, party events, or party disbanding logic.

## Architectural Separation
- **No Shared Classes or Data Structures:**
  - Parties and guilds are implemented in entirely separate modules and files.
  - No shared state, event systems, or persistence layers.
- **Distinct Use Cases:**
  - Parties: Temporary player groups for adventuring, with dynamic membership and lifecycle.
  - Guilds: Persistent organizations in the world, with their own buildings, NPCs, and quests.
- **No Cross-Triggering:**
  - Disbanding a party does not affect guild membership or state.
  - Guild operations (joining, leaving, managing) are handled independently of party logic.

## References
- `backend/core/systems/party/PartyManager.ts` (Party logic)
- `src/poi/models/SocialPOI.ts` (Guild logic)
- `utils/buildingFactory.ts` (Guild building creation)
- `types/buildings/social.ts` (GuildHall type)

---

This separation ensures maintainability, clarity, and prevents unintended side effects between party and guild systems.

# Party Data Persistence, Versioning, Migration, and Recovery

## Overview
This document describes the architecture, components, and operational procedures for the party data persistence layer, including versioning, migration, and recovery mechanisms. It is intended for developers, maintainers, and integrators working with party data in Visual DM.

---

## Architecture & Components

- **PartyRepository**: Handles all CRUD operations for party data, enforces transaction-based persistence, atomicity, and data integrity via SHA-256 checksums.
- **Schema Versioning**: Each party record stores a `schema_version`. The repository uses a strategy pattern to handle upgrades and backward compatibility.
- **Migration Framework**: The `PartyMigrationManager` manages migration paths, batch migration, validation, and rollback. Migration functions are registered for each version pair.
- **Recovery Manager**: The `PartyRecoveryManager` provides point-in-time recovery (via WAL), automated backups, restore, and integrity validation.

### Diagram: High-Level Architecture
```
[Client/API] -> [PartyRepository] -> [DB]
                        |-> [Versioning]
                        |-> [MigrationManager]
                        |-> [RecoveryManager]
```

---

## Recovery Procedures

### 1. Restore from Backup
1. Stop all writes to the party table.
2. Use `PartyRecoveryManager.restore_from_backup('party_backup_<timestamp>.json')`.
3. Validate with `PartyRecoveryManager.validate_recovery()`.
4. Resume normal operations.

### 2. Point-in-Time Recovery
1. Stop all writes to the party table.
2. Use `PartyRecoveryManager.point_in_time_recovery('party_wal.log', '<target_timestamp>')`.
3. Validate with `PartyRecoveryManager.validate_recovery()`.
4. Resume normal operations.

### 3. Automated Backup
- Backups are created automatically every N seconds (configurable).
- Use `PartyRecoveryManager.list_backups()` to view available backups.

---

## Troubleshooting Guide
- **Checksum mismatch**: Indicates possible data corruption. Restore from backup or WAL.
- **Migration failure**: Use rollback support in `PartyMigrationManager`. Check migration function logic.
- **Backup validation fails**: Do not restore from this backup. Use an earlier backup.
- **Automated backup not running**: Ensure the recovery manager thread is started and not stopped.

---

## Integration Points
- **Reputation System**: PartyRepository is the single source of truth for party membership, which is referenced by reputation calculations.
- **Emotion System**: Party membership changes trigger emotion events; subscribe to repository events or use hooks.
- **Interaction System**: Party state is used for interaction eligibility and outcomes; always query via the repository for up-to-date data.

---

## Code Examples

### Creating a Party
```python
from app.core.repositories.party_repository import PartyRepository
repo = PartyRepository(session)
party = repo.create_party({
    'name': 'Adventurers',
    'leader_id': 1,
    # ... other fields ...
})
```

### Migrating a Party to a New Schema Version
```python
from app.core.repositories.party_repository import PartyMigrationManager
migration_manager = PartyMigrationManager(session)
def migration_fn(party):
    # ... migration logic ...
    return party
migration_manager.register_migration('1.0.0', '1.1.0', migration_fn)
migration_manager.migrate_party(party, '1.1.0')
```

### Restoring from Backup
```python
from app.core.repositories.party_repository import PartyRecoveryManager
recovery_manager = PartyRecoveryManager(session)
recovery_manager.restore_from_backup('party_backup_20240516T120000.json')
recovery_manager.validate_recovery()
```

---

## Developer Guide: Extending the Persistence Layer
- **Add a new schema version**: Subclass `PartyVersionStrategy`, implement upgrade/downgrade, and register in `PartyVersionRegistry`.
- **Add a migration**: Register a migration function in `PartyMigrationManager` for the version pair.
- **Add a new recovery workflow**: Extend `PartyRecoveryManager` with new methods as needed.
- **Integrate with new systems**: Use repository hooks/events for consistency.

- ...and any other stubs with identical Q&A

**Current State:**
- These are empty stubs or minimal implementations with no real logic or documentation.

**Best Practices:**
- Each class or function should encapsulate its intended logic, be fully documented, and include clear API/usage examples.
- Unit (and where appropriate, integration) tests should cover all relevant scenarios and edge cases.

**Improvement Recommendations:**
- Implement the actual logic for each stub.
- Document the class/function and its methods.
- Add comprehensive unit and integration tests.

**Status:**
- Stub; needs full implementation, documentation, and tests.
