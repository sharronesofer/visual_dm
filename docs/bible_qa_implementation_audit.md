## Prioritized Summary of Missing/Partial Features

1. **Dialogue System**: No real dialogue manager, dialogue UI, or GPT integration logic. High priority for narrative-driven games.
2. **Inventory System**: No inventory management or UI. Core gameplay feature, high priority.
3. **Character System**: No character builder or stats system. Essential for RPGs, high priority.
4. **UI System**: No UI manager or HUD. Required for player interaction, high priority.
5. **Networking System**: No real networking logic or message passing. Critical for multiplayer, high priority.
6. **State Management System**: No robust state management or serialization. Important for game logic, medium-high priority.
7. **Storage System**: No save/load or persistence logic. Needed for progress retention, medium priority.
8. **Monitoring/Analytics**: No performance profiling or analytics. Important for debugging and optimization, medium priority.

### Recommendations for Implementation Order
1. Dialogue, Inventory, Character, and UI systems should be implemented first, as they are core to gameplay and user experience.
2. Networking and State Management should follow, especially if multiplayer or complex game logic is required.
3. Storage and Monitoring/Analytics can be implemented in parallel or after core systems are functional.
