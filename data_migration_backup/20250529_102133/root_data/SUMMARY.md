# Data System Alignment Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to align the data system with the requirements specified in the Development Bible and outlines the remaining work needed for complete alignment.

## Completed Changes

### 1. Directory Structure Reorganization
- ✅ Created a hierarchical directory structure organized by domain
- ✅ Established dedicated directories for each data domain (biomes, entities, items, etc.)
- ✅ Set up specialized subdirectories for system-specific data (memory, motif, rumor, etc.)
- ✅ Migrated existing data files to appropriate locations

### 2. File Format Standardization
- ✅ Established new file format with required metadata
- ✅ Implemented version, last_updated, and description fields
- ✅ Created data wrapper for actual content
- ✅ Updated existing files to follow the new format

### 3. Data Access Layer
- ✅ Created utility functions for loading data files
- ✅ Enhanced error handling and validation
- ✅ Updated GameDataRegistry to use the new structure
- ✅ Added support for loading data from multiple domain directories

### 4. Documentation
- ✅ Created README.md for high-level overview
- ✅ Created DATA_STRUCTURE.md for detailed data organization
- ✅ Created DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md for practical usage guidance
- ✅ Created MIGRATION_NOTES.md to document the migration process
- ✅ Created IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md to explain the changes made

### 5. Migration Tools
- ✅ Created a migration script for converting data files
- ✅ Added interactive mode for handling unmapped files
- ✅ Implemented fallback support for legacy formats

## Remaining Work

### 1. Event-Driven Updates
- ❌ Implement event notifications for data changes
- ❌ Connect to the central event dispatcher
- ❌ Define data-specific event types
- ❌ Add event listeners in the GameDataRegistry

### 2. Data Validation
- ❌ Create JSON schemas for data validation
- ❌ Implement schema validation in loading process
- ❌ Add validation utilities
- ❌ Create schema documentation

### 3. Additional Data Domains
- ❌ Implement remaining data loaders for all domains
- ❌ Create sample data files for testing
- ❌ Update GameDataRegistry to handle all domains
- ❌ Add domain-specific access methods

### 4. Caching and Performance
- ❌ Implement data caching for frequently accessed data
- ❌ Add memory-efficient loading for large data sets
- ❌ Optimize access patterns for common operations
- ❌ Add performance metrics

### 5. Modding Support
- ❌ Define layered data loading for mods
- ❌ Implement data overrides and extensions
- ❌ Create API for runtime data modifications
- ❌ Document modding interface

## Next Steps

1. **Short term (immediate)**:
   - Update any dependent systems to use the new data structure
   - Validate that all systems can access the migrated data
   - Run the migration script on all existing data files

2. **Medium term (next few iterations)**:
   - Implement event-driven updates to align with event dispatcher
   - Create JSON schemas for data validation
   - Add loaders for remaining data domains

3. **Long term (future enhancements)**:
   - Implement caching mechanisms for performance
   - Develop modding support
   - Add more robust data validation
   - Create specialized data editors

## Alignment with Development Bible

The changes align with these key principles from the Development Bible:

- **Modular, Event-Driven Architecture**: Data is now organized by domain, ready for event-driven communication
- **Clear Responsibility Boundaries**: Each data domain has its own directory and scope
- **Extensibility**: The structure makes it easy to add new data domains
- **Data Persistence with JSON and Versioning**: All files include version information for compatibility
- **Loose Coupling**: The data system is now abstracted behind a consistent interface

The remaining work will complete the alignment by integrating the event system and implementing validation as specified in the Development Bible.
