# Task ID: 55
# Title: Clean Up Directory Structure Inconsistencies
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 51
# Priority: low
# Description: Resolve minor directory naming inconsistencies in the Systems folder to improve maintainability and reduce developer confusion
# Details:
**Inconsistencies to Fix:**
- Consolidate `quest/` and `quests/` directories
- Consolidate `npc/` and `npcs/` directories  
- Consolidate `faction/` and `factions/` directories
- Consolidate `character/` and `characters/` directories
- Consolidate `time/` and `timesystem/` directories
- Consolidate `worldgen/` and `worldgeneration/` directories
- Consolidate `motif/` and `motifs/` directories

**Recommended Consolidation:**
- Keep singular forms: `quest/`, `npc/`, `faction/`, `character/`
- Keep more descriptive names: `timesystem/`, `worldgeneration/`
- Move duplicate `motifs/` content into `motif/`

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Audit content in duplicate directories
2. Merge overlapping functionality
3. Update assembly definitions
4. Fix namespace references
5. Update documentation references
6. Remove empty directories

**Impact Assessment:**
- Minimal risk as most directories are currently empty
- Improves long-term maintainability
- Reduces confusion for new developers

# Test Strategy:
Verify no compilation errors after consolidation. Check that all assembly references work correctly. Ensure Unity meta files are properly updated. Test that existing functionality is not broken.
