### Details:
Current repository lacks proper error handling, bulk operations for performance, and transaction safety that tests expect.

## 3. Implement Advanced Stack Management System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create stack split/merge operations, automatic stack optimization, and stackable item validation
### Details:
Tests expect sophisticated stack management including ItemOperations.split_item_stack(), merge_item_stacks(), and automatic stack optimization.

## 4. Create Equipment Slot Management System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement equipment slot validation, equip/unequip operations, and equipment-specific constraints
### Details:
Frontend expects equipment slot management with validation. Tests expect EquipmentOperations.equip_item() and unequip_item() methods.

## 5. Implement Position-Based Inventory Management [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create grid-based inventory system with position validation and item movement operations
### Details:
Tests expect ItemOperations.move_item_to_position() and position-based validation. Frontend expects grid-based inventory UI support.

## 6. Enhance API Router with Comprehensive Error Handling [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add sophisticated error handling, response formatting, and advanced query parameters to API endpoints
### Details:
Current router missing comprehensive error handling that tests expect. Need proper HTTP status codes, detailed error messages, and response formatting.

## 7. Implement Real-Time Event Integration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate inventory operations with event system for real-time updates and cross-system communication
### Details:
Tests expect InventoryNotifier integration with events. Frontend expects real-time inventory updates via WebSocket/event system.

## 8. Create Advanced Filtering and Search System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement sophisticated filtering, sorting, and search capabilities for inventory items

Tests expect advanced filtering by category, rarity, equipped status, weight, value. Frontend expects sophisticated search and filter UI support.

## 9. Implement Transaction Safety and Rollback [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add transaction safety, rollback capabilities, and idempotency key support for inventory operations
### Details:
Frontend expects transaction safety with idempotency keys. Tests expect rollback capabilities for failed operations and atomic transaction support.

## 10. Fix Cross-System Integration Points [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure proper integration with economy, equipment, crafting, and loot systems
### Details:
