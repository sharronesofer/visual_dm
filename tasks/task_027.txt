# Task ID: 27
# Title: Complete Character System Implementation - Bridge Critical Gaps
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: critical
# Description: Address the critical gaps between comprehensive test expectations and current character system implementation (currently 45% complete)
# Details:
Based on analysis of /backend/tests/systems/character (49 test files, 962 test cases) versus /backend/systems/character implementation, significant gaps exist:

**Current State Assessment:**
- Core Models: 60% complete ✅
- Visual System: 0% complete ❌ 
- Event Integration: 20% complete ⚠️
- API Layer: 10% complete ❌
- Database Layer: 70% complete ✅
- Business Services: 80% complete ✅
- Test Infrastructure: 5% complete ❌

**Critical Issues:**
- Missing visual model in character system (exists in utils/visual/ but not integrated)
- Broken event system imports causing fallback classes in tests
- No REST API endpoints despite comprehensive schemas
- Missing core character_model.py that tests expect
- Broken shared database module imports in tests
- Incomplete Character Builder integration

**Impact:** Character system cannot support frontend integration or full gameplay features until these gaps are addressed.

# Test Strategy:
1. All 962 character tests pass without fallback classes
2. Visual model tests use actual character system implementation
3. Event system integration works end-to-end
4. REST API endpoints respond correctly
5. Database operations complete successfully
6. Character builder integration functional

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate Visual Model into Character System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Move and integrate visual model from utils/visual/ into backend.systems.character.models.visual_model to match test expectations
### Details:
Tests expect backend.systems.character.models.visual_model with CharacterModel, MeshSlot, BlendShape, MaterialAssignment, AnimationState classes. Current implementation exists in utils/visual/visual_model.py but is not integrated with character system.

Tasks:
1. Copy visual_model.py to backend/systems/character/models/
2. Update imports in character system to use local visual model
3. Integrate visual model with Character ORM model
4. Add visual_model field to Character model
5. Update character service to handle visual operations
6. Test visual model integration with character CRUD operations

## 2. Fix Event System Integration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Resolve broken event system imports and implement proper canonical events integration
### Details:
Many test files show fallback event classes due to import failures. Need to:

1. Fix imports for backend.systems.events modules
2. Ensure EventDispatcher is properly accessible
3. Implement missing canonical events for character system
4. Update character services to properly dispatch events
5. Test event system end-to-end integration
6. Remove fallback event classes from tests

## 3. Create Missing Core Character Model [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create backend.systems.character.core.character_model.py that tests expect
### Details:
Tests import from backend.systems.character.core.character_model but file doesn't exist. Need to:

1. Create character_model.py in core/ directory
2. Implement Character class that tests expect
3. Ensure compatibility with existing Character ORM model
4. Implement proper model relationships and methods
5. Update imports throughout character system
6. Test model functionality against test requirements

## 4. Implement Complete REST API Layer [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create FastAPI routers and endpoints for full character system API
### Details:
Currently routers/ directory is empty but schemas exist and tests expect full API. Need to:

1. Create character_router.py with CRUD endpoints
2. Create relationship_router.py for character relationships
3. Create mood_router.py for mood management
4. Create goal_router.py for goal management
5. Implement proper error handling and validation
6. Add authentication and authorization
7. Test all endpoints against API schemas

## 5. Fix Test Infrastructure and Database Module [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Resolve broken test imports and implement missing shared database infrastructure
### Details:
Many tests fail with 'ModuleNotFoundError: No module named backend.systems.shared.database'. Need to:

1. Create missing backend.systems.shared.database.base module
2. Implement proper database session management
3. Fix conftest.py imports and test fixtures
4. Remove fallback classes from test files
5. Implement proper test isolation and cleanup
6. Ensure all 962 character tests run without import errors

## 6. Complete Character Builder Integration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Fully integrate CharacterBuilder with Character model and implement missing methods
### Details:
CharacterBuilder exists but integration is incomplete. Tests expect fuller integration. Need to:

1. Enhance Character.to_builder() method implementation
2. Improve CharacterBuilder.finalize() integration with Character model
3. Add missing builder validation and error handling
4. Implement builder pattern for character updates
5. Test builder integration with character service
6. Ensure builder supports all character features
