# Task ID: 7
# Title: Migrate Quest and Arc Narrative Systems
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Migrate quest management and arc systems that handle the core narrative functionality
# Details:
Migrate narrative systems with comprehensive UI support:

1. **Quest System Migration**:
   - Move quest code to new Quest/ directory
   - Implement quest DTOs and API integration
   - Create quest log and tracking UI
   - Add quest creation and editing tools
   - Implement quest objective tracking

2. **Arc System Migration**:
   - Migrate arc system to new Arc/ directory
   - Align with backend arc progression
   - Create arc visualization and tracking UI
   - Implement narrative flow interfaces
   - Add arc analytics and reporting

3. **Integration Features**:
   - Quest-arc relationship management
   - Real-time quest state synchronization
   - Narrative branching visualization
   - Progress tracking and analytics

4. **UI Components**:
   - Quest log with filtering and search
   - Quest creation and editing wizard
   - Arc progression timeline
   - Narrative tree visualization
   - Objective tracking overlay

# Test Strategy:
1. Test quest creation and progression flows
2. Verify arc tracking and visualization
3. Test narrative branching functionality
4. Validate backend quest synchronization
5. Confirm UI provides clear quest guidance

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Complete Arc System Backend Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the entire Arc system backend from scratch - 0% currently implemented despite being marked as done
### Details:
CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION GAP: The entire Arc system backend needs to be built from scratch.

Current Reality: backend/systems/arc/ directory is COMPLETELY EMPTY

Required Implementation:

1. CORE MODELS (backend/systems/arc/models/):
   - Arc: Main entity with narrative structure, progression, metadata
   - ArcStep: Individual steps with completion criteria and narrative text  
   - ArcProgression: Analytics and progression tracking
   - ArcCompletionRecord: Completed arcs with outcomes
   - Supporting enums for types, statuses, and priorities

2. SERVICES LAYER (backend/systems/arc/services/):
   - ArcManager: Core service for arc lifecycle management
   - ArcGenerator: GPT-powered arc generation with templates
   - ProgressionTracker: Advanced analytics and monitoring
   - QuestIntegrationService: Bridge arcs with quest system

3. REPOSITORY LAYER (backend/systems/arc/repositories/):
   - ArcRepository, ArcStepRepository, ProgressionRepository
   - Full database operations and complex queries
   - Data persistence and analytics support

4. API INFRASTRUCTURE (backend/systems/arc/routers/):
   - arc_router.py: 20+ endpoints for CRUD operations
   - analytics_router.py: 15+ endpoints for metrics and reporting
   - WebSocket integration for real-time updates
   - Comprehensive validation and error handling

5. GPT INTEGRATION UTILITIES:
   - Dynamic arc generation with configurable prompts
   - Template system for different arc types
   - Content generation and narrative tools

6. EVENT SYSTEM INTEGRATION:
   - ArcEvent and ArcEventType for system communication
   - Cross-system event handling and publishing

All 17 test files (1,639 lines) expect this functionality but none exists. This blocks frontend integration and represents the most severe implementation gap in the project.

## 2. Fix Arc System Test Infrastructure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Resolve all 17 failing Arc test files that expect comprehensive functionality
### Details:
Arc Test Infrastructure Crisis:

CURRENT STATE: All 17 Arc test files fail with import errors because ZERO implementation exists.

FAILING TESTS:
- test_models.py (28 lines) - Arc, ArcStep, ArcProgression, ArcCompletionRecord models
- test_services.py (1,639 lines) - Massive service expectations
- test_routers.py (839 lines) - API endpoint tests
- test_repositories.py - Database operation tests  
- test_integration.py - Cross-system integration tests
- Plus 12 additional test files

PRIMARY ISSUES:
1. Import failures: All tests fail on 'from backend.systems.arc.models import...'
2. Missing modules: No backend.systems.arc modules exist
3. Placeholder tests: Many contain 'assert True' placeholders
4. Missing database integration: Tests expect SQLAlchemy models but none exist

REQUIRED FIXES:
1. Implement all Arc system modules that tests import
2. Replace placeholder test logic with real validation
3. Create proper test fixtures and database setup
4. Ensure all 17 test files pass with real functionality
5. Add comprehensive test coverage for Arc operations

DEPENDENCIES: Requires completion of Arc system backend implementation (subtask 7.1)

This is blocking all Arc system validation and integration testing.

## 3. Update Development Bible Arc System Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Correct the false claim of Arc system being 'FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED' in the Development Bible
### Details:
Documentation Accuracy Crisis:

CURRENT PROBLEM: The Development Bible contains completely false information about the Arc system.

FALSE CLAIMS IN DEVELOPMENT BIBLE:
- 'Status: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED'
- 'Complete Arc System implementation including models, services, repositories, and API endpoints'
- 'Integration Test: All components tested and working correctly'
- 'GPT integration utilities with prompt templates and content generation'
- '20+ endpoints for full CRUD operations, activation, and management'

REALITY:
- Status: ❌ 0% IMPLEMENTED - Directory is completely empty
- No models, services, repositories, or API endpoints exist
- No integration tests possible - all fail with import errors  
- No GPT integration exists
- Zero endpoints implemented

REQUIRED CORRECTIONS:
1. Update Arc system status to '❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED'
2. Remove all false implementation claims
3. Add accurate status: 'CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION GAP - 0% Complete'
4. Document the scope of work needed
5. Add warning about frontend integration being blocked
6. Update task tracking to reflect actual implementation status

IMPACT OF FALSE DOCUMENTATION:
- Misleads developers about system readiness
- Blocks accurate project planning and estimation
- Causes integration failures when systems assume Arc system exists
- Creates false confidence in project completeness

This documentation must be corrected to prevent further development based on false assumptions.
