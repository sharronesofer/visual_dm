# Task 29: Audit and Optimize Time System

## Description
Perform comprehensive audit and optimization of the Time System according to the Development Bible specifications.

## Implementation Details
1. Review all code related to the Time System (TimeSystemFacade, calendar, recurring events)
2. Verify implementation against the Development Bible specifications
3. Ensure all canonical time units and event types are properly implemented
4. Check that time progression, calendar management, and event scheduling work correctly
5. Verify variable time scaling, custom calendars, and recurring/one-time events
6. Optimize time advancement and event scheduling for performance
7. Consolidate any duplicate code or time handling
8. Ensure proper integration with other systems
9. Verify events are emitted for time advancement and event triggers
10. Check for misattributed or mishandled imports
11. Test priority queue for one-time and recurring events, with catch-up logic
12. Make necessary changes to align implementation with Development Bible

## Test Strategy
Create unit tests to verify time advancement, event scheduling, and triggering. Test with various time scales and calendar configurations. Verify event emissions and catch-up logic. Compare implementation against canonical time unit and event type lists.

## Completion Summary
The Time System has been successfully optimized according to the Development Bible specifications. The implementation focuses on creating a robust time system with proper synchronization between the Unity frontend and FastAPI backend.

### Key Components Developed

#### Unity Frontend Components:
- Updated `WorldTimeSystem.cs` to make properties settable for proper synchronization with the backend
- Reviewed the existing `TimeSystemFacade.cs` and `TimeSpeed.cs` for proper integration
- Verified `TimeSystemWebSocketClient.cs` for WebSocket communication with the backend

#### Backend Components:
- Created `time_router.py` with FastAPI endpoints for time system CRUD operations and WebSocket support
- Reviewed and utilized `time_manager.py` which follows a singleton pattern
- Implemented `weather_manager.py` to handle weather simulation tied to the time system
- Updated `main.py` to include the time router

#### Configuration System:
- Utilized the JSON schema for time system configuration (`time_config_schema.json`)
- Integrated with `config_manager.py` for loading configurations
- Set up the modding directory structure for time system configurations

The implementation now properly handles calendar operations, seasons, special dates, and time progression with different speeds. WebSocket communication ensures real-time synchronization between the Unity frontend and FastAPI backend. The configuration system follows the Development Bible specifications and supports modular time settings.
