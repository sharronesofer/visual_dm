# Task ID: 34
# Title: Complete Economy System Implementation - Bridge Critical API Integration Gap
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 26, 27, 28
# Priority: critical
# Description: Address critical gaps between comprehensive test expectations and current economy system implementation (currently 35-40% complete)
# Details:
Based on comprehensive analysis of backend/tests/systems/economy (25+ test files expecting EconomyManager with 25+ methods) versus backend/systems/economy implementation, the economy system is approximately 35-40% complete with critical gaps blocking frontend integration.

**COMPLETION ASSESSMENT: 35-40% Complete**

**✅ IMPLEMENTED (35-40% Complete):**
- **Comprehensive Services Layer (80% complete)**: 
  - resource_service.py (744 lines) - Full resource CRUD operations
  - market_service.py (640 lines) - Market operations and pricing
  - trade_service.py (323 lines) - Trade route management
  - futures_service.py (582 lines) - Commodity futures operations
- **Complete Models (90% complete)**: resource.py, market.py, trade_route.py, commodity_future.py
- **Shop Implementation (85% complete)**: shop_routes.py (516 lines), shop_utils.py (355 lines)
- **Documentation (95% complete)**: README.md (190 lines) describing comprehensive functionality

**❌ MISSING CRITICAL COMPONENTS (60-65% Missing):**

**1. EconomyManager Main API Layer (0% Complete - CRITICAL BLOCKER)**:
- backend/systems/economy/__init__.py tries to import EconomyManager from .economy_manager but file doesn't exist
- Found comprehensive implementation in archives/zombie_monoliths/economy_manager.py (1000+ lines)
- This is the main coordination layer that provides the API surface for frontend integration
- All 25+ test files expect EconomyManager class with methods like get_resource, create_market, process_tick, etc.

**2. Test Infrastructure (0% Complete - NO VALIDATION)**:
- All 25 test files contain only 'assert True' placeholders instead of real validation logic
- test_economy_manager.py (531 lines) expects comprehensive EconomyManager testing
- test_economy_service.py shows expected integration with EventDispatcher, Resource models
- Cannot validate any functionality without proper tests

**3. API Endpoints Layer (5% Complete - FRONTEND BLOCKER)**:
- No FastAPI routers for frontend integration
- Unity frontend EconomyWebSocketHandler.cs expects 7+ WebSocket channels
- Frontend expects comprehensive REST API that doesn't exist
- Shop routes exist but no core economy API endpoints

**4. Event System Integration (10% Complete - NO REAL-TIME)**:
- No WebSocket integration for real-time price updates
- No event publishing for market changes
- Frontend expects real-time economy events but backend doesn't provide them
- Economic forecasting and analytics missing

**5. Database Session Management (Incomplete)**:
- Services exist but database operations need validation
- Missing shared database module (same issue affecting other systems)
- No proper dependency injection for database sessions

**DEVELOPMENT BIBLE COMPLIANCE:**
The Development Bible defines comprehensive economy requirements:
- Resource management system ✅ (Implemented in services)
- Market operations and pricing ✅ (Implemented in services)
- Trade route management ✅ (Implemented in services)
- Economic forecasting ❌ (Missing in main API layer)
- Real-time price updates ❌ (Missing event integration)
- Integration with other systems ❌ (Missing coordination layer)

**FRONTEND INTEGRATION CRISIS:**
Unity frontend expects comprehensive economy API but backend lacks the main coordination layer:
- EconomyWebSocketHandler.cs expects 7 WebSocket channels: economy, market, prices, transactions, trade_routes, currencies, metrics
- Frontend DialogueService shows economy integration expectations
- VDM/Assets/Scripts/Runtime/Economy/ contains full UI system expecting backend API
- Frontend completely blocked without EconomyManager coordination layer

**IMPACT ON PROJECT:**
- Economy functionality completely non-functional for gameplay
- Frontend cannot integrate without main API coordination layer
- Economic gameplay features impossible (trading, markets, pricing)
- Other systems cannot interact with economy features
- Critical gameplay system missing despite significant service layer implementation

This represents a system with solid foundations (services and models) but missing the critical integration layer that coordinates everything and provides the API surface that frontend expects. The refactor session mentioned by user likely removed the main EconomyManager coordination layer without proper replacement.

# Test Strategy:
1. All 25 economy test files pass with real validation logic instead of placeholders
2. EconomyManager successfully coordinates all economic operations
3. Complete API layer with FastAPI endpoints responds correctly
4. WebSocket integration provides real-time economic updates matching frontend expectations
5. Event system integration publishes economic events for other systems
6. Frontend EconomyWebSocketHandler.cs successfully communicates with backend
7. Full economic workflow from resource creation to market trading works end-to-end
8. Database operations complete successfully with proper session management

# Subtasks:
## 1. Restore Missing EconomyManager Coordination Layer [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the missing economy_manager.py that backend/__init__.py imports and all tests expect
### Details:
**CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE MISSING: EconomyManager Coordination Layer**

All 25+ economy test files expect backend.systems.economy.economy_manager with comprehensive EconomyManager class:

**Found Complete Implementation:**
archives/zombie_monoliths/economy_manager.py (1000+ lines) contains the missing implementation

**Required EconomyManager Methods (from test analysis):**
- **Resource Management**: get_resource, create_resource, update_resource, delete_resource, get_resources_by_region
- **Market Operations**: get_market, create_market, calculate_price, update_market_prices, get_market_trends
- **Trade Routes**: get_trade_route, create_trade_route, process_trade_routes, calculate_trade_profits
- **Futures Contracts**: get_future, create_future, settle_future, calculate_future_price
- **Economic Processing**: process_tick, calculate_price_index, generate_economic_forecast, update_economic_metrics
- **Analytics**: get_economic_analytics, generate_economic_report, track_economic_trends
- **Integration**: initialize_economy, shutdown_economy, get_economy_status

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Restore from Archives**: Copy and adapt economy_manager.py from archives/zombie_monoliths/
2. **Update Dependencies**: Ensure compatibility with current service layer architecture
3. **Service Integration**: Integrate with existing ResourceService, MarketService, TradeService, FuturesService
4. **Database Session**: Add proper database session management
5. **Event Integration**: Add event publishing for economic state changes
6. **API Surface**: Provide clean interface for FastAPI router integration

**Critical Features:**
- Singleton pattern for economy management
- Service coordination and orchestration
- Economic simulation and processing
- Real-time economic calculations
- Cross-system integration points
- Performance optimization for economic operations

This is the MOST CRITICAL missing piece - without EconomyManager, no tests can run and frontend cannot integrate.
