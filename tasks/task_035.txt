# Task ID: 35
# Title: Create Missing Integration System Infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34
# Priority: critical
# Description: Implement critical integration system infrastructure that's blocking multiple systems from functioning
# Details:
Based on integration test analysis, the Integration System is only 5% complete with critical missing infrastructure blocking multiple systems:

CRITICAL MISSING MODULES:
- backend.systems.integration.state_sync (0% implemented - expected by tests)
- backend.systems.integration.validation (0% implemented - expected by tests)  
- backend.systems.integration.monitoring (0% implemented - expected by tests)
- backend.systems.shared.database.base (0% implemented - blocking multiple systems)

INTEGRATION TEST EXPECTATIONS (63 lines in test_integration_utils.py):
- Async event registration/dispatch functionality
- State sync with callbacks and rollback capabilities
- Pydantic schema validation integration
- Comprehensive monitoring with logging/metrics/alerting
- Event bus integration for cross-system communication

CURRENT WORKING COMPONENTS:
- utils/event_bus.py - Basic async EventBus implementation (43 lines) with singleton
- backend/systems/quest/integration.py - Working cross-system integration example (629+ lines)

CROSS-SYSTEM IMPORT FAILURES:
- backend/systems/world_state/ modules failing to import missing integration components
- Multiple test files across character system expecting integration modules
- Pattern of systems expecting integration infrastructure that doesn't exist

IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
- Integration system failure blocking cross-system functionality
- Missing shared database module causing import failures across multiple systems  
- Event system fragmentation preventing proper cross-system communication
- Infrastructure gaps preventing comprehensive integration testing

This foundational infrastructure must be implemented to unblock auth_user, character, crafting, analytics, data, dialogue, diplomacy, and economy systems.

# Test Strategy:
1. All integration tests in test_integration_utils.py pass without import errors\n2. Shared database module resolves import failures across all systems\n3. State sync functionality handles cross-system data synchronization\n4. Validation module provides comprehensive schema validation\n5. Monitoring module delivers logging, metrics, and alerting\n6. Event bus integration enables proper cross-system communication\n7. All dependent systems can successfully import and use integration infrastructure
