# Task ID: 30
# Title: Complete Analytics System Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 26, 27, 28
# Priority: critical
# Description: Bridge critical gaps between comprehensive test expectations and current analytics system implementation
# Details:
Based on analysis of backend/tests/systems/analytics (28 test files, 4,871 lines of test code) versus backend/systems/analytics implementation, the analytics system has MASSIVE gaps preventing functionality and integration.

COMPLETION ASSESSMENT: 5% Complete

✅ IMPLEMENTED (5% Complete):
- Analytics middleware in events system (basic event capture)
- Some dialogue analytics integration (partial)

❌ MISSING CRITICAL COMPONENTS (95% Missing):

1. Core Analytics Service (0% Complete):
- Expected: backend.systems.analytics.services.analytics_service with AnalyticsService, AnalyticsEventType, get_analytics_service
- Reality: File doesn't exist - all tests fail with import errors

2. Schema System (0% Complete): 
- Expected: backend.systems.analytics.schemas with 15 canonical event schemas (GameStartEvent, GameEndEvent, MemoryEvent, RumorEvent, etc.)
- Reality: No schemas directory or files

3. Utility Functions (0% Complete):
- Expected: backend.systems.analytics.utils with aggregate_events_by_time, filter_events_by_metadata, generate_llm_training_dataset, etc.
- Reality: No utils directory or functions

4. Event Integration (0% Complete):
- Expected: Comprehensive event system integration with analytics middleware
- Reality: Basic middleware exists but no proper integration

5. API Layer (0% Complete):
- Expected: FastAPI routers for analytics endpoints
- Reality: No API endpoints exist

6. Storage System (0% Complete):
- Expected: Structured data storage with date/category organization
- Reality: Basic file writing in middleware only

DEVELOPMENT BIBLE COMPLIANCE:
The Development Bible defines analytics as collecting and processing gameplay data for metrics analysis and performance monitoring, including:
- Event tracking (❌ Missing comprehensive tracking)
- Metrics collection (❌ Missing metrics system)
- Usage pattern analysis (❌ Missing analysis tools)
- Performance monitoring (❌ Missing monitoring)

CRITICAL ISSUES:
- 28 test files expect comprehensive analytics functionality that doesn't exist
- Frontend cannot integrate without backend analytics API
- No gameplay metrics or analysis possible
- LLM training dataset generation not implemented
- Performance monitoring non-functional

IMPACT ON PROJECT:
- Analytics functionality completely non-functional
- Game telemetry and improvement impossible
- LLM training data collection broken
- Performance optimization blocked
- Critical gameplay system missing

# Test Strategy:
1. All 28 analytics test files pass with real validation logic
2. AnalyticsService successfully captures and processes events
3. All 15 canonical event schemas validate correctly
4. Utility functions handle data aggregation and filtering
5. API endpoints respond correctly for analytics operations
6. LLM training dataset generation works end-to-end

- get_analytics_middleware() - Middleware creation

Features Required:
- Singleton pattern implementation
- Async queue processing for performance
- Event dispatcher integration
- Structured file storage by date/category
- Dataset generation for LLM training
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Test mode support for isolated testing

## 2. Create Analytics Schema System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the missing backend.systems.analytics.schemas module with 15 canonical event schemas
### Details:
Tests expect backend.systems.analytics.schemas with comprehensive Pydantic models:

Required Base Classes:
- AnalyticsEventBase - Base class for all analytics events with timestamp, event_type, entity_id

Required Event Schemas (15 canonical types):
1. GameStartEvent - session_id, user_id, client_info
2. GameEndEvent - session_id, session_duration, reason
3. MemoryEvent - memory_id, action, memory_type, relevance
4. RumorEvent - rumor_id, action, spread_count, mutation_level
5. MotifEvent - motif_id, action, intensity, narrative_impact
6. PopulationEvent - location_id, action, population_change, demographics
7. POIStateEvent - poi_id, action, state_change, discovery_data
8. FactionEvent - faction_id, action, reputation_change, relationship_data
9. QuestEvent - quest_id, action, progress_change, completion_data
10. CombatEvent - combat_id, action, participants, outcome
11. TimeEvent - time_change, period, calendar_impact
12. StorageEvent - action, data_type, operation_type
13. RelationshipEvent - relationship_id, action, entities, relationship_change
14. WorldStateEvent - state_id, action, change_type, impact_scope
15. CustomEvent - custom_type, data (flexible schema)

Required Supporting Functions:
- EVENT_TYPE_MAPPING - Dictionary mapping event types to classes
- get_event_model(event_type) - Factory function for event models

Schema Requirements:
- Full Pydantic validation with proper field types
