**FRONTEND CHAOS SYSTEM INTEGRATION:**
Implement Unity frontend components to support the chaos system, focusing on admin monitoring tools and subtle player-facing effects without revealing the underlying chaos mechanics.

**CORE REQUIREMENTS:**

**1. Admin Monitoring Interface (Hidden from Players):**
- Create admin-only chaos monitoring dashboard
- Real-time chaos pressure visualization
- Historical chaos event tracking and analytics
- Chaos threshold configuration interface
- System pressure breakdown displays
- Mitigation factor effectiveness tracking

**2. Unity Components Structure:**
- VDM/Assets/Scripts/Runtime/Systems/Chaos/
  - Models/ChaosModels.cs (ChaosEvent, PressureSource, ChaosMetrics DTOs)
  - Services/ChaosService.cs (Backend API communication)
  - UI/Admin/ChaosMonitoringPanel.cs (Admin dashboard)
  - UI/Admin/PressureVisualization.cs (Pressure charts and graphs)
  - UI/Admin/ChaosConfigPanel.cs (Threshold configuration)
  - Integration/ChaosEventHandler.cs (WebSocket event handling)

**3. API Integration:**
- HTTP client for chaos system API endpoints
- WebSocket integration for real-time chaos updates
- Admin authentication for chaos monitoring access
- Secure configuration management interface
- Historical data retrieval and caching

**4. Subtle Player-Facing Effects (No Direct Chaos Exposure):**
- Environmental mood indicators affected by chaos pressure
- Subtle UI ambience changes during high chaos periods
- Background music and audio cues influenced by regional chaos
- Weather and atmospheric effects correlating with chaos events
- NPC behavior and dialogue influenced by chaos state

**5. Event System Integration:**
- Subscribe to chaos events via WebSocket
- Handle chaos-triggered environmental changes
- Coordinate with existing Unity event systems
- Support for real-time world state updates
- Integration with narrative event displays

**6. Admin Dashboard Features:**
- Real-time chaos pressure meters for each system
- Regional chaos heat maps
- Event history timeline with detailed logs
- Threshold adjustment controls with immediate feedback
- System weight configuration interface
- Mitigation factor tracking and effectiveness analysis

**7. Data Visualization:**
- Interactive charts for pressure trends over time
- System contribution breakdowns (pie charts, bar graphs)
- Regional chaos distribution maps
- Event frequency and impact analysis
- Correlation displays between systems and chaos triggers

**8. Security and Access Control:**
- Admin role verification for chaos monitoring access
- Secure configuration change authentication
- Audit logging for chaos system modifications
- Role-based access control for different admin levels
- Debug mode controls for development testing

**9. Performance Considerations:**
- Efficient data streaming for real-time updates
- Optimized rendering for complex visualizations
- Background processing for chaos calculations
- Minimal impact on gameplay performance
- Intelligent caching of historical data

**10. Integration Testing:**
- End-to-end chaos event simulation testing
- Admin dashboard functionality validation
- WebSocket connection stability testing
- API integration verification
- Performance impact assessment

**PLAYER EXPERIENCE GOALS:**
- Zero direct exposure to chaos mechanics
- Immersive world that feels alive and reactive
- Subtle environmental storytelling through chaos effects
- Enhanced narrative depth through systematic unpredictability
- Rich emergent gameplay through chaos-driven events

**ADMIN EXPERIENCE GOALS:**
- Comprehensive chaos system monitoring and control
- Real-time insights into world pressure dynamics
- Effective tools for tuning chaos behavior
- Clear visualization of system interactions
- Historical analysis capabilities for pattern recognition

**TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE:**
- Clean separation between admin and player interfaces
- Secure admin-only chaos monitoring endpoints
- Efficient real-time data streaming
- Modular components for easy maintenance
- Integration with existing Unity game architecture

**TESTING REQUIREMENTS:**
- Admin dashboard displays accurate chaos data
- Real-time updates function correctly
- Configuration changes apply immediately
- Player-facing effects are subtle and immersive
- Performance impact is minimal
- Security controls prevent unauthorized access

# Test Strategy:
1. Admin dashboard accurately displays real-time chaos data
2. Configuration changes apply correctly to backend system
3. Player-facing effects are subtle and immersive without revealing chaos mechanics
4. WebSocket integration provides smooth real-time updates
5. Security controls prevent unauthorized chaos system access
6. Performance impact on gameplay is negligible
7. Integration with existing Unity systems works seamlessly
8. Historical data visualization provides meaningful insights
