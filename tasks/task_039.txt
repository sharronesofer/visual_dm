# Title: Complete Loot System Refactor and Test Alignment - Fix Critical Module Structure and Implementation Gaps
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 37
# Priority: high
# Description: Rebuild loot system from current 35% completion to full functionality with proper module structure, comprehensive testing, and Unity frontend integration
# Details:
**CRITICAL LOOT SYSTEM REBUILD REQUIRED**

Comprehensive analysis of backend/tests/systems/loot reveals the loot system is only 35% complete with massive structural misalignment between current implementation and test expectations. The recent refactoring session exposed fundamental architectural issues:

**CURRENT CRITICAL FAILURES:**
- Wrong module structure - tests expect backend.systems.loot.loot_core but implementation uses backend.systems.loot.core
- Missing LootManager singleton class entirely (all 11+ tests expect this core class)
- Missing shop system completely (loot_shop.py with dynamic pricing, specialization, economics)
- Missing proper event classes (tests expect ItemIdentificationEvent, ItemEnhancementEvent, ShopInventoryEvent, ShopTransactionEvent)
- Missing validation functions expected by tests (validate_item, calculate_item_power_score)
- Unity frontend has complete directory structure but no implementation files
- No proper integration with inventory, economy, and faction systems

**CURRENT WORKING COMPONENTS (35% completion):**
- Core loot generation functionality scattered across core.py, generation.py, database.py
- Some event classes exist in loot_utils_core.py but wrong module name for tests
- Location-specific loot generation implemented and working
- Basic API routes exist in loot_routes.py
- Database integration partially implemented

**MISSING COMPONENTS (65% of functionality):**
- LootManager coordination layer (all tests expect backend.systems.loot.loot_manager import)
- Complete shop system with dynamic pricing based on region economics
- Missing event classes for shop operations and item enhancement
- Unity frontend implementation (Models/, Services/, UI/, Integration/ directories exist but empty)
- Cross-system integration points with inventory, economy, faction systems
- AI-enhanced item naming (currently stub implementation only)
- Item identification and enhancement systems
- Shop specialization and economic factor calculations

**DEVELOPMENT BIBLE REQUIREMENTS STATUS:**
✅ Context-sensitive loot generation (implemented)
✅ Level-appropriate scaling (implemented)
❌ AI-enhanced naming and flavor text (stub only)
❌ Shop mechanics with dynamic pricing (completely missing)
✅ Location-specific generation (implemented)
⚠️ Event-driven architecture (partially implemented, wrong structure)
❌ Cross-system integration (missing)
❌ Item identification system (missing)
❌ Item enhancement system (missing)

**TEST FAILURES:**
- All imports fail due to wrong module names (loot_core vs core)
- LootManager class doesn't exist (singleton pattern expected)
- Missing shop functions: get_shop_type_specialization, get_region_economic_factors, get_dynamic_item_price
- Missing core functions: group_equipment_by_type, validate_item, calculate_item_power_score
- Missing event classes cause import errors
- Unity integration impossible due to missing backend APIs

**FRONTEND INTEGRATION GAPS:**
- Unity expects structured loot services but backend provides fragmented functionality
- Missing WebSocket integration for real-time loot notifications
- No proper API structure for shop system integration
- Missing event system integration for inventory updates

This refactor will restructure the module architecture, implement missing functionality, and enable proper Unity frontend integration, bringing the system from 35% to 95% completion with full test coverage.

# Test Strategy:
1. All 11+ loot test files pass without import errors
2. Module structure aligns with test expectations (loot_core.py, loot_manager.py, loot_shop.py, loot_events.py)
3. LootManager singleton class implemented with all expected methods
4. Shop system provides dynamic pricing and economic factor calculations
5. Event classes enable proper integration with inventory and economy systems
6. Unity frontend can successfully integrate with loot API
7. Cross-system integration works with inventory, economy, and faction systems
8. AI-enhanced naming provides meaningful item names and descriptions
9. Item identification and enhancement systems work end-to-end
10. Full loot workflow from generation to shop purchase works correctly
11. WebSocket integration provides real-time loot and shop notifications
