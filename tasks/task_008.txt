# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Chaos System - Hidden Narrative Engine
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7, 26, 27, 28
# Priority: critical
# Description: Create a hidden chaos system that injects sudden destabilizing events into the game world based on accumulated pressure from system interactions
# Details:
**CHAOS SYSTEM OVERVIEW:**
Implement a sophisticated hidden narrative engine that monitors system pressure across the game world and triggers sudden, dramatic destabilizing events when thresholds are exceeded. This system operates completely behind the scenes to create emergent storytelling opportunities through systematic chaos generation.

**CORE FUNCTIONALITY REQUIREMENTS:**

**1. Pressure Monitoring Engine:**
- Monitor aggression thresholds across all game systems (motif, faction conflicts, economic instability, diplomacy failures)
- Track resource scarcity and population stress indicators
- Monitor political tension and leadership instability
- Assess military buildups and territorial disputes
- Track environmental pressures and climate changes

**2. Weighted Chaos Calculation:**
- Implement configurable weighting system for different pressure sources
- Calculate composite chaos scores using multiple input metrics
- Support dynamic threshold adjustment based on world state
- Include temporal factors (pressure buildup over time)
- Handle regional vs global chaos calculations

**3. Event Trigger System:**
- Define chaos event categories: Political upheaval, Natural disasters, Economic collapse, War outbreak, Resource scarcity, Faction betrayals, Character revelations
- Implement sudden event triggering when thresholds exceeded
- Create cascading secondary effects across multiple systems
- Support event chains and consequence propagation
- Include event cooldown periods to prevent spam

**4. Mitigation Factor Integration:**
- Weight diplomatic actions and stability measures as chaos reducers
- Factor in successful quest completions and positive faction relations
- Include infrastructure development and resource management
- Account for strong leadership and effective governance
- Support both player and NPC-driven mitigation efforts

**5. Cross-System Integration:**
- Integrate with existing event dispatcher for real-time communication
- Trigger effects in faction, economy, region, NPC, and quest systems
- Support bidirectional pressure feedback from affected systems
- Coordinate with motif system for narrative coherence
- Include analytics tracking for chaos event impacts

# Test Strategy:
1. Chaos pressure accurately calculated from multiple system inputs
2. Event triggering occurs at appropriate thresholds without being predictable
3. Cross-system effects propagate correctly through event dispatcher
4. Mitigation factors effectively reduce chaos pressure
5. Historical tracking enables analysis of chaos patterns
6. Configuration system allows tuning of chaos behavior
7. System remains completely hidden from player interface
8. Performance impact minimal on real-time gameplay
