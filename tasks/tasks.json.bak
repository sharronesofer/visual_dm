Event System Integration Broken**\n- Event dispatcher integration failures throughout system\n- No real-time diplomatic event notifications\n- Cross-system event communication non-functional\n- WebSocket integration incomplete\n\n**4.

Test Infrastructure (0% Complete - NO VALIDATION)**:\n- All 25 test files contain only 'assert True' placeholders instead of real validation logic\n- test_economy_manager.py (531 lines) expects comprehensive EconomyManager testing\n- test_economy_service.py shows expected integration with EventDispatcher, Resource models\n- Cannot validate any functionality without proper tests\n\n**3.

      "details": "**CRITICAL LOOT SYSTEM REBUILD REQUIRED**\n\nComprehensive analysis of backend/tests/systems/loot reveals the loot system is only 35% complete with massive structural misalignment between current implementation and test expectations. The recent refactoring session exposed fundamental architectural issues:\n\n**CURRENT CRITICAL FAILURES:**\n- Wrong module structure - tests expect backend.systems.loot.loot_core but implementation uses backend.systems.loot.core\n- Missing LootManager singleton class entirely (all 11+ tests expect this core class)\n- Missing shop system completely (loot_shop.py with dynamic pricing, specialization, economics)\n- Missing proper event classes (tests expect ItemIdentificationEvent, ItemEnhancementEvent, ShopInventoryEvent, ShopTransactionEvent)\n- Missing validation functions expected by tests (validate_item, calculate_item_power_score)\n- Unity frontend has complete directory structure but no implementation files\n- No proper integration with inventory, economy, and faction systems\n\n**CURRENT WORKING COMPONENTS (35% completion):**\n- Core loot generation functionality scattered across core.py, generation.py, database.py\n- Some event classes exist in loot_utils_core.py but wrong module name for tests\n- Location-specific loot generation implemented and working\n- Basic API routes exist in loot_routes.py\n- Database integration partially implemented\n\n**MISSING COMPONENTS (65% of functionality):**\n- LootManager coordination layer (all tests expect backend.systems.loot.loot_manager import)\n- Complete shop system with dynamic pricing based on region economics\n- Missing event classes for shop operations and item enhancement\n- Unity frontend implementation (Models/, Services/, UI/, Integration/ directories exist but empty)\n- Cross-system integration points with inventory, economy, faction systems\n- AI-enhanced item naming (currently stub implementation only)\n- Item identification and enhancement systems\n- Shop specialization and economic factor calculations\n\n**DEVELOPMENT BIBLE REQUIREMENTS STATUS:**\n✅ Context-sensitive loot generation (implemented)\n✅ Level-appropriate scaling (implemented)\n❌ AI-enhanced naming and flavor text (stub only)\n❌ Shop mechanics with dynamic pricing (completely missing)\n✅ Location-specific generation (implemented)\n⚠️ Event-driven architecture (partially implemented, wrong structure)\n❌ Cross-system integration (missing)\n❌ Item identification system (missing)\n❌ Item enhancement system (missing)\n\n**TEST FAILURES:**\n- All imports fail due to wrong module names (loot_core vs core)\n- LootManager class doesn't exist (singleton pattern expected)\n- Missing shop functions: get_shop_type_specialization, get_region_economic_factors, get_dynamic_item_price\n- Missing core functions: group_equipment_by_type, validate_item, calculate_item_power_score\n- Missing event classes cause import errors\n- Unity integration impossible due to missing backend APIs\n\n**FRONTEND INTEGRATION GAPS:**\n- Unity expects structured loot services but backend provides fragmented functionality\n- Missing WebSocket integration for real-time loot notifications\n- No proper API structure for shop system integration\n- Missing event system integration for inventory updates\n\nThis refactor will restructure the module architecture, implement missing functionality, and enable proper Unity frontend integration, bringing the system from 35% to 95% completion with full test coverage.",

Implement dialogue system tests first - all modules exist\n2. Focus on existing system capabilities\n3. Build momentum with working tests\n\n**Phase 2 - Missing System Evaluation (188 tests):**\n1. Combat system (18 tests) - High priority, partially implemented\n2. Economy system (12 tests) - Evaluate implementation need\n3. Loot system (12 tests) - Evaluate implementation need\n4. Other systems - Evaluate based on development priorities\n\n**Phase 3 - Cleanup:**\n1. Remove tests for systems not planned for implementation\n2. Create stub modules for planned but not implemented systems\n3. Ensure test coverage aligns with actual development roadmap\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:**\n- Start with dialogue tests (backend/tests/systems/dialogue/) - 19 files\n- Use actual module capabilities for test logic\n- Follow test patterns from working systems (arc, character)\n- Remove or stub tests for non-existent modules\n- Maintain canonical test structure per development bible\n\n**IMPACT:**\n- Removes 207 meaningless 'assert True' tests\n- Provides real test coverage for implemented systems\n- Clarifies which systems exist vs planned\n- Improves development workflow and CI/CD reliability\n- Reduces noise in test output",
