# Task ID: 47
# Title: Complete Region System Implementation - Bridge Critical 70% Functionality Gap
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: critical
# Description: Address catastrophic gaps between test expectations and current implementation. Currently only 25-30% complete with major architectural failures preventing testing and integration.
# Details:
**CRITICAL ISSUES DISCOVERED:**
1. Missing essential models layer (RegionMetadata, ContinentMetadata, RegionProfile, hex coordinates)
2. Incomplete world generation system (no continent management, biome validation, procedural algorithms)
3. Database integration failure (file-based instead of SQLAlchemy, missing shared database module)
4. API layer gaps (missing world metadata, continent endpoints, WebSocket integration)
5. Broken cross-system integration (events, faction, character, quest systems)
6. Test infrastructure failure (tests can't run due to missing dependencies)
7. Development bible misalignment (missing "full upfront generation" paradigm)
8. No Unity frontend implementation

**IMPACT:**
- Prevents world simulation functionality
- Blocks frontend region/mapping features  
- Breaks integration with faction, quest, NPC systems
- Creates massive technical debt

# Test Strategy:
1. All region test files pass without import errors
2. Database integration enables proper data persistence
3. World generation creates complete continents and regions
4. API endpoints support full region functionality
5. Cross-system integration works with faction, character, and quest systems
6. Frontend can successfully integrate with region API
7. Full world generation paradigm from development bible is implemented
