Overview\nThe Group Formation System enables both player characters and NPCs to form, join, leave, and interact within structured groups (\"parties\"). Its primary goals are to:\n- Facilitate dynamic party creation and management for collaborative gameplay and AI behaviors\n- Support a variety of group types (ad hoc, persistent, system-driven)\n- Integrate with core systems such as Reputation, Emotion, and Interaction for emergent group dynamics\n- Provide robust mechanisms for party leadership, role assignment, and group objectives\n- Ensure persistence and scalability for large numbers of parties and members\n\n**Design Philosophy:**\n- Flexibility: Support both player-initiated and system-driven group formation\n- Transparency: Clear rules for joining, leaving, and leadership transitions\n- Integration: Seamless data flow with related systems (see Section 9)\n- Robustness: Handle edge cases (e.g., simultaneous join/leave, betrayal, splits)\n\n# 2. Party Creation, Joining, and Disbanding Mechanics\n\n## 2.1 Party Creation\n- Parties can be created by players (manual initiation), by system triggers (e.g., quest events, AI logic), or automatically (e.g., proximity, shared goals).\n- Creation may require meeting eligibility criteria (level, reputation, quest status, etc.).\n- System should support both temporary (ad hoc) and persistent parties.\n\n## 2.2 Joining and Leaving\n- Joining a party may be by invitation, open enrollment, or automatic (e.g., after completing a shared objective).\n- Restrictions may apply (party size limit, reputation threshold, conflicting allegiances).\n- Leaving can be voluntary or forced (e.g., kicked by leader, system rule violation).\n- Edge cases: Simultaneous join/leave requests, race conditions, and handling of \"ghost\" members.\n\n## 2.3 Disbanding\n- Parties disband when all members leave, the leader disbands, or system rules trigger dissolution (e.g., inactivity, quest completion).\n- Disbanding should trigger cleanup of party data and notify all members.\n- Edge cases: Disbanding during combat, with pending invitations, or with unresolved objectives.\n\n# 3. Role Assignment and Hierarchy\n- Available roles should include Leader, Officer, Member, and potentially specialized roles (Scout, Healer, etc.)\n- Role assignment methods should be flexible: manual assignment by leader, automatic based on skills/attributes, or democratic voting\n- Clear permissions hierarchy with inheritance and delegation capabilities\n- Leadership succession protocols for when a leader leaves (automatic to highest officer, voting, or disbanding)\n- Role transitions should be tracked for reputation impact and history\n\n# 4. Party-Based AI Decision Making and Behavior Patterns\n- AI-controlled parties should demonstrate coordinated tactical behaviors based on party composition\n- Decision-making algorithms should consider:\n  * Party goals and objectives\n  * Individual member capabilities and roles\n  * Environmental factors and threats\n  * Historical interactions and reputation\n- Group tactics should include formations, coordinated attacks/defense, and role-based actions\n- AI parties should be able to adapt to changing circumstances (member loss, environmental changes)\n- Behavior patterns should vary based on party type (military unit vs. merchant caravan vs. adventuring party)\n</info added on 2025-05-09T18:33:25.748Z>\n<info added on 2025-05-09T18:57:41.894Z>\n# 5. Party Objectives and Goal-Sharing Mechanisms\n- Parties can have shared objectives (quests, missions, goals) that synchronize across members.\n- Objectives may be set by the leader, voted on, or system-assigned.\n- Individual goals may align or conflict with party goals; system should handle divergence (e.g., member leaves, splits, or betrays).\n- Mechanisms for updating, tracking, and resolving objectives must be robust.\n\n# 6. Inter-Party Relationships and Dynamics\n- Parties can form alliances, rivalries, or remain neutral with respect to other parties.\n- Relationship status may be influenced by shared history, reputation, or explicit actions (e.g., betrayal, aid).\n- System should support dynamic changes (e.g., alliance to rivalry) and handle edge cases (e.g., betrayal during joint quest).\n- Inter-party dynamics impact gameplay: access to shared resources, joint objectives, or PvP.\n\n# 7. Party Size Limitations and Scaling\n- Default party size limits should be configurable (e.g., 4-8 for adventuring, larger for armies).\n- Special cases (e.g., raid groups, system events) may override limits.\n- System must scale to support many parties in proximity (performance, UI, data integrity).\n- Edge cases: exceeding limits, merging/splitting large groups, handling overflow.\n\n# 8. Persistence of Parties Across Game Sessions\n- Party state (members, roles, objectives, relationships) must persist across logins and server restarts.\n- Data structures should support efficient storage and retrieval.\n- Migration logic for version updates or schema changes.\n- Handling persistence failures: recovery, notifications, and data integrity checks.\n\n# 9. Integration Points with Related Systems\n- **Reputation System:** Party formation, trust, and leadership eligibility may depend on reputation (see [docs/reputation-system-qa.md](mdc:docs/reputation-system-qa.md)).\n- **Emotion System:** Loyalty, morale, and betrayal likelihood are influenced by party and individual emotional states.\n- **Interaction System:** Governs how parties interact with the world, other parties, and system events.\n- Integration must be robust, with clear data flows and error handling.\n\n# 10. Diagrams and Data Flows\n- System architecture diagram: party, member, and relationship entities.\n- Data flow: party creation, joining, disbanding, and integration with other systems.\n- Class diagrams: party, member, objective, relationship.\n- Sequence diagrams for key scenarios (e.g., party split, betrayal, merge).\n\n# 11. Examples and Edge Cases\n- Example: Player-initiated party forms for a quest, splits after disagreement, one subgroup allies with a rival party.\n- Example: System-formed party for a raid, leader leaves, automatic succession, party persists across sessions.\n- Edge case: Simultaneous join/leave requests, party disbands during combat, conflicting objectives.\n\n# 12. Open Questions and Stakeholder Clarifications (Q&A Preparation)\n**Party Mechanics:**\n1. What are the default and maximum party size limits for different group types?\n2. Should party creation always require a leader, or can leaderless parties exist?\n3. How are roles assigned and changed—manual, automatic, or by vote?\n4. What triggers party disbanding, and are there exceptions (e.g., persistent guilds)?\n5. How should the system handle simultaneous join/leave requests or race conditions?\n\n**Objectives & Dynamics:**\n6. How are party objectives set—by leader, vote, or system?\n7. How should conflicting individual and party goals be resolved?\n8. What mechanisms should govern party loyalty and betrayal?\n9. How do alliances and rivalries form and dissolve between parties?\n10. What are the edge cases for party splits, merges, or betrayals?\n\n**Integration & Persistence:**\n11. How does party reputation affect eligibility for leadership or membership?\n12. How should party emotional state (morale, loyalty) be tracked and influence behavior?\n13. What are the critical integration points with Reputation, Emotion, and Interaction systems?\n14. What are the requirements for party data persistence, recovery, and migration?\n15. Are there any known technical or gameplay pain points with current group systems?\n\n# 13. Change Log and Revision History\n- Track all updates based on Q&A outcomes and implementation feedback.\n- Version/date, summary of changes, author.\n\n---\n\n**Ready for Q&A session: All major areas are documented and a comprehensive set of stakeholder questions is prepared.**\n</info added on 2025-05-09T18:57:41.894Z>",

The unique modifier system eliminates the need for duplicate prevention mechanisms. Drop rates will maintain constant probabilities with special considerations for certain game scenarios. The inventory management approach will force players to make strategic decisions rather than automatically handling overflow. Group loot distribution will incorporate NPC interactions to enhance gameplay.\n\nTechnical requirements have been specified in detail. A hybrid pre-generation strategy will be implemented to balance performance and randomness. Caching mechanisms have been designed specifically to support GPT integration for procedural content. Asynchronous processing requirements have been documented to ensure smooth gameplay during loot generation.\n\nNew system needs have been identified and documented, including a Nemesis-inspired system similar to Shadow of Mordor, a mathematical formula governing legendary item progression, and a plugin architecture to support seasonal events and future expansions.\n\nThe preparation is now complete with all materials ready for the interactive session.
