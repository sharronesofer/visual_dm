# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Missing NPC Service Layer Infrastructure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the complete backend.systems.npc.services module with NPCService class that all tests expect
### Details:
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE GAP: All 5,385 lines of NPC tests expect backend.systems.npc.services.npc_service but this module doesn't exist.

REQUIRED IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Create backend/systems/npc/services/ directory
2. Implement NPCService class with singleton pattern
3. Add CRUD operations: create_npc, get_npc, update_npc, delete_npc, list_npcs
4. Implement memory management: get_npc_memories, add_memory_to_npc, forget_memory
5. Add faction management: add_faction_to_npc, remove_faction_from_npc, get_npc_factions
6. Implement rumor system: add_rumor_to_npc, forget_rumor, get_npc_rumors
7. Add motif management: apply_motif, remove_motif, get_npc_motifs
8. Implement get_npc_service() convenience function
9. Add proper error handling and logging
10. Include event system integration for real-time updates

This is blocking ALL NPC-related testing and integration with other systems.

## 2. Implement Comprehensive NPC API Router Layer [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create complete API endpoints for NPC system operations including memory, faction, rumor, and population management
### Details:
API INFRASTRUCTURE GAP: Tests expect 20+ comprehensive API endpoints but only basic routing exists.

REQUIRED ENDPOINTS:
1. Memory Management APIs:
   - GET /api/npc/systems/memories/{npc_id} - Retrieve NPC memories
   - POST /api/npc/systems/memories/{npc_id} - Create new memory
   - DELETE /api/npc/systems/memories/{npc_id}/{memory_id} - Delete memory
   - GET /api/npc/systems/memories/{npc_id}/summary - Memory summary

2. Faction Management APIs:
   - GET /api/npc/systems/factions/{npc_id} - Get NPC faction affiliations
   - POST /api/npc/systems/factions/{npc_id} - Add faction affiliation
   - DELETE /api/npc/systems/factions/{npc_id}/{faction_id} - Remove affiliation

3. Rumor System APIs:
   - GET /api/npc/systems/rumors/{npc_id} - Get NPC rumors
   - POST /api/npc/systems/rumors/{npc_id} - Add rumor

This is critical for data persistence and integration with other systems.

## 4. Implement Autonomous NPC Behavior Simulation System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the autonomous NPC simulation system required by development bible for NPCs to pursue independent goals across the world
### Details:
AUTONOMOUS BEHAVIOR REQUIREMENT: Development bible mandates autonomous NPC simulation but current implementation has only reactive behavior.

DEVELOPMENT BIBLE REQUIREMENTS:
'NPCs must autonomously pursue goals, form relationships, generate conflicts, and evolve throughout the world regardless of player proximity.'

REQUIRED AUTONOMOUS BEHAVIORS:
1. Independent Goal Pursuit:
   - NPCs generate personal objectives (marriage, career advancement, revenge, exploration)
   - Goal prioritization and planning systems
   - Progress tracking and adaptation

2. Relationship Evolution:
   - NPCs form friendships, rivalries, romantic relationships autonomously
   - Dynamic relationship networks that change over time
   - Social interaction simulation

3. Economic Participation:
   - NPCs engage in trade, accumulate wealth, start businesses
   - Compete for resources and opportunities
   - Economic decision-making algorithms

4. Political Engagement:
   - NPCs join factions, seek leadership roles
   - Participate in diplomatic activities
   - Political ambition simulation

5. Quest Generation and Completion:
   - NPCs create their own quests based on problems/opportunities
   - Attempt to complete objectives with probabilistic outcomes
   - Quest failure/success consequences

6. Knowledge and Information:
   - NPCs learn information and spread rumors
   - Make decisions based on accumulated knowledge
   - Information network simulation

7. Life Cycle Management:
   - Aging, reproduction, death with generational turnover
