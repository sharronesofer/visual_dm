# Title: Create Unity UI Framework and Core Components
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 51, 52
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the foundational UI framework and core components in VDM/Assets/Scripts/UI/ to support all game systems with consistent, modern interface design
# Details:
**Core UI Framework:**
- BaseUIPanel - Foundation class for all UI panels
- UIManager - Central UI management and navigation
- ModalSystem - Modal dialogs and confirmations
- NotificationSystem - Toast messages and alerts
- LoadingSystem - Loading screens and progress indicators

**System UI Components:**
```

├── Components/     # Reusable UI components
├── Systems/        # System-specific UI
│   ├── Region/     # Region maps and info panels
│   ├── Character/  # Character sheets and progression
│   ├── Combat/     # Combat interface and actions

│   └── Quest/      # Quest log and tracking
├── Prefabs/        # UI prefab definitions
└── Themes/         # Visual themes and styling
```

**Modern UI Features:**
- Responsive design system
- Dark/light theme support
- Accessibility considerations
- Touch and mouse input support
- Animation and transition system

# Test Strategy:
Create test scenes for each UI component. Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes. Verify accessibility features work correctly. Test theme switching and ensure all components update properly.
